  <h1 class="post-title">Quod Libet and arrogance</h1>
  <span class="post-date">2007-08-19</span>
  <p>I've just seen, for the first time in memory, a concept of arrogant
design stated <a href="http://mystilleef.blogspot.com/2006/12/031-coming-soon-to-distro-near-you.html#c4991460165173246170">publicly</a>, a concept whose awareness previously existed
only in my mind. This concept was brought up by my experiences with
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/quodlibet/">Quod Libet</a>, my favorite audio player. It unfortunately doesn't
conform to some common standards:</p>
<ul>
<li>I can't open a song directly from a file manager (Nautilus)
requiring me to open the application itself first, as if it's the
standard operating environment, yet it's folder view is less than
perfect, in that it doesn't automatically update the contents if
changed externally.</li>
<li>It doesn't use well-known shortcuts like B for previous track and N
for next track, and invents its own, and if there's not enough
already.</li>
<li>It does not allow me to drag a folder containing tracks, meaning I
have to use its own interface to open all tracks.</li>
</ul>
<p>As regards the first link here, someone else also stated that Scribes'
design is arrogant too, though I don't think so. Scribes is just
excellent and I don't see the need for another editor, except if it had
code 'folding' and started-up faster than the current Scribes' 10
seconds. [<strong>update</strong>: such <a href="http://tshepang.net/project-of-note-geany">a replacement</a> was eventually discovered!]</p>
