  <h1 class="post-title">blog of note: We&#x27;ll See (Matt Zimmerman)</h1>
  <span class="post-date">2010-12-03</span>
  <p>I'm a regular reader of <a href="http://planet.debian.org/">Planet Debian</a>, so I frequently bump onto Matt
Zimmerman's blog. This a Debian Developer who also happens to do paid
work on Ubuntu as well (employed by Canonical). He writes clearly and
with a sober and mature tone. It's very interesting when you see a
software developer conversant with non-technical stuff, and able to
write about it so well.</p>
<ul>
<li>I started with one post with an obviously interesting title, &quot;<a href="http://mdzlog.alcor.net/2010/06/12/how-to-decide-what-to-read-and-what-not-to-read/">How
to decide what to read (and what not to read)?</a>&quot;. This piqued my
interest also because I've been thinking about <a href="http://tshepang.net/where-i-live-on-the-web">my own activities
on the web</a> too. Also, his mention of News closely match mine, other
than that I'm simply (mostly) not interested in traditional big
news (presidents approves blah) and tabloids, and normally get
enough of a dose from co-workers and friends, and mostly
face-to-face.</li>
<li>This led to another, &quot;<a href="http://mdzlog.alcor.net/2010/04/06/breadth-and-depth/">Breadth and depth</a>&quot;, in which he touches on
the social effects of web-enabled technology. This is a topic that
has been beaten to death of course, but he fortunately keeps his
contribution very brief and fresh, and I like that he doesn't claim
to offer any solutions, but merely exploring them.</li>
<li>And there was &quot;<a href="http://mdzlog.alcor.net/2009/05/03/internet-discussion-trends/">Internet discussion trends: from Usenet to
micro-blogs</a>&quot;, where he discussed various ways forms of on-line
discussion, which is the first topic of its type I've seen yet.</li>
<li>He even dabbled with a bit of poetry in &quot;<a href="http://mdzlog.alcor.net/2010/12/02/breathing-information/">Breathing information</a>&quot;.
Nice attempt.</li>
<li>He also displays an insightful understanding of what package
management in &quot;<a href="http://mdzlog.alcor.net/2010/07/06/weve-packaged-all-of-the-free-software-what-now/">We've packaged all of the free software...what
now?</a>&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<p>There's a whole bunch of gorgeous-sounding posts that I didn't care to
read yet, and hope to keep the above list updated when I do.</p>
