  <h1 class="post-title">hierarchy of individuals in FLOSS projects</h1>
  <span class="post-date">2013-11-16</span>
  <p>From top to bottom:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Author</p>
<p>Sometimes referred to as primary author, to distinguish between
other people who have contributed to the project, this is the
creator. At times, someone in the lower ranks of the hierarchy
happen to be more active in the project than the Author, in which
case the Author often makes them Maintainer, explicitly or not.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maintainer</p>
<p>This is someone ultimately responsible for the project: handles bug
reports, decides which changes to accept from lower contributors,
and performs releases. Note that there can be more than one, unlike
is the case with Author.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contributor</p>
<p>This is someone who submits improvements to project, either
documentation or code. It can be a one-time contribution, but in
case where this is frequent and spans a certain amount of time, she
can move onto becoming a Maintainer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bug Reporter</p>
<p>This is someone who suggests improvements to the project. Depending
on the project, any of these are used: a mailing list, an IRC
channel, a social networking service, email, or a dedicated
Issue/Bug tracking system can be used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>User</p>
<p>What the user is depends on the project, of course. Just to be
clear, in the case of Python project, the user is a software
developer, not the person who ends up using something written in the
language.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The 'individual' in title means I'm ignoring non-human entities, like
companies. I'm also ignoring non-core activities, like marketers or
sysadmins, or even teachers. Those are not going to be easy to fit in
this simple story, and are not common to that many FLOSS (Free/Libre and
Open Source) projects.</p>
<p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p>
<p>In the case of <a href="http://linux.togaware.com/survivor/wajig.html">wajig</a>, I am the Maintainer and Graham Williams is the
Author. In the case of <a href="https://github.com/paramiko/paramiko">paramiko</a>, a far more important project, <a href="http://bitprophet.org/blog/2012/09/29/paramiko-and-ssh">Jeff
Forcier is the Maintainer</a>. The project was however created by <a href="http://robey.lag.net">Robey
Pointer</a>, and <a href="http://robey.lag.net/2009/02/16/paramiko-is-on-github-now.html">he did not imagine</a> it would end up being THE Python SSH
library today.</p>
