                <description>&lt;p&gt;The best movie of the year is &lt;em&gt;Contagion&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;,
boasting &lt;strong&gt;best direction&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; (so realistic, also fast-paced),
&lt;strong&gt;best dialog&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; (so fresh),
&lt;strong&gt;best cast&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; (it has several big actors, all of whom went beyond their famous personas),
and &lt;strong&gt;best editing&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; (so smooth).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My &lt;strong&gt;favorite performance&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is that of &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Andrew_Howard&quot;&gt;Andrew Howard&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; as the Russian
gangster in &lt;em&gt;Limitless&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. The movie also has my most &lt;strong&gt;favorite story
concept&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;, that of a drug that vastly improves mental performance.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most &lt;strong&gt;desirable gal&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Kelly_Reilly&quot;&gt;Kelly Reilly&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;sherlock-holmes-a-game-of-shadows&quot;&gt;Sherlock Holmes: A Game
of Shadows&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. She is followed by &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Marion_Cotillard&quot;&gt;Marion Cotillard&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Contagion&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <title>2009 review</title>
                <pubDate>Thu, 26 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
                <link>http://tshepang.net/2009-review/</link>
                <guid>http://tshepang.net/2009-review/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;best movie&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; of the year is also the best movie ever to be based
in my city of residence, Johannesburg.
The movie also has &lt;strong&gt;best visuals&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;,
as its battle suit is the &lt;strong&gt;best visual effects artefact&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;.
In addition, it&#x27;s also the &lt;strong&gt;most original&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; movie, which helps it feel super-fresh.
The movie is named &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;district-9&quot;&gt;District 9&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;best male performance&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is that of Christoph Waltz as Nazi officer
in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;inglourious-basterds&quot;&gt;Inglourious Basterds&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.
He plays a very fearsome Nazi officer that is so damn easy to hate.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best &lt;strong&gt;cast&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; can be found in &lt;em&gt;Precious&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.
Among them is the most &lt;strong&gt;desirable gal&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;, Amina Robinson,
who plays the more quiet of the classmates, one with scar on face.
Oh man, why do people have to look and be like her. Damn!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <title>District 9</title>
                <pubDate>Thu, 26 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
                <link>http://tshepang.net/district-9/</link>
                <guid>http://tshepang.net/district-9/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;The documentary style has been employed elsewhere before, but there&#x27;s
nothing quite like &lt;em&gt;District 9&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; in all movie history. Its weird and
wonderful story starts off with nice comic touches and transitions into
a harrowing tale of human torture, and ends as some action-adventure of
sorts, complete with superb visual effects, with some nice creature
ideas.
Sure there&#x27;s warts here and there (I could not stand the resilience of
the villain, and I found the gang leader ridiculous), but to have a gem like this
emerge from my country of residence, South Africa, is quite something.
It is the best movie based there. The lead performance also deserves
applaud.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <title>Inglourious Basterds</title>
                <pubDate>Thu, 26 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
                <link>http://tshepang.net/inglourious-basterds/</link>
                <guid>http://tshepang.net/inglourious-basterds/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;The first scene is top-class, for the performance of the weary farmer
when forced to make an unpleasant choice, the sort where I feel
self-death is better. The best performance of the movie however is that
of Christoph Waltz, who plays the Nazi officer questioning him. Brad
Pitt is quite limited in terms of talent but not charisma, and here
provides the weakest performance of all key characters. Quentin
Tarantino is a weirdo who possesses the freedom (perhaps too much) to
paint whatever he pleases on screen, and luckily got the talent. He
gives this one superb suspense, exciting dialog, unusual (and
unpredictable) story, and wonderful editing. It&#x27;s my favorite and best
of all his works, followed by &lt;em&gt;Reservoir Dogs&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One interesting, and rare, thing is I enjoyed the movie a lot more on a
revisit. The second revisit was not so impressive... felt like an
overlong and pompous waste. The praise remains though.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <title>2018 review</title>
                <pubDate>Wed, 27 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
                <link>http://tshepang.net/2018-review/</link>
                <guid>http://tshepang.net/2018-review/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;The greatest &lt;strong&gt;spectacle&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is &lt;em&gt;Ready Player One&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; (great supply of
iconic fictional characters, fantastic environment, and story concept).
The movie also has the best &lt;strong&gt;animation&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best &lt;strong&gt;humor&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is found in &lt;em&gt;Deadpool 2&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;,
a sequel that also happens to be better than the (delightful) original.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best &lt;strong&gt;thriller&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is the intense &lt;em&gt;Mile 22&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;,
and its &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Iko_Uwais&quot;&gt;Iko Uwais&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; gives the year&#x27;s &lt;strong&gt;favorite performance&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;.
The movie also has the best &lt;strong&gt;action direction&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;.
Runner-up for &lt;strong&gt;favorite performance&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is by &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Jesse_Plemons&quot;&gt;Jesse Plemons&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Game
Night&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/2017-review/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;best performance&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is given by Holly Hunter in &lt;em&gt;The Big Sick&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.
Her character also forms half of &lt;strong&gt;best romantic couple&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;,
together with Ray Romano. Ray also happens to give a wonderful performance
(and I must note that I don&#x27;t remember experiencing his work before).
This couple is probably the best I&#x27;ve yet seen.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <link>http://tshepang.net/2016-review/</link>
                <guid>http://tshepang.net/2016-review/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;best movie&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; of the year is &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;captain-fantastic&quot;&gt;Captain Fantastic&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. The movie also
boasts &lt;strong&gt;best direction&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;best script&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best &lt;strong&gt;visual effects&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; can be found in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;deadpool&quot;&gt;Deadpool&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, a movie that
also boasts best &lt;strong&gt;action direction&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;humor&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My &lt;strong&gt;favorite character&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is Black Panther (&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;captain-america-civil-war&quot;&gt;Captain America: Civil
War&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;), and runner-up is Leslie Jones in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;ghostbusters&quot;&gt;Ghostbusters&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. The &lt;strong&gt;best
performance&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is by Simon Helberg in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;florence-foster-jenkins&quot;&gt;Florence Foster Jenkins&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, while
the best &lt;strong&gt;character design&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is that of the Hollows of &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;miss-peregrine-s-home-for-peculiar-children&quot;&gt;Miss
Peregrine&#x27;s Home for Peculiar Children&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I found the writing and direction excellent, and the acting very
competent. The funeral was very touching, and its simplicity admirable.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a minor complaint, I wish grandpa, the only real adversary in the
movie, was not so soon forgotten by the writers. Also, I suspect a less
fairy-taily ending would have made for an even better movie.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless, the whole thing offers a fantastic (and refreshing)
examination of a self-educated and self-sufficient family.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Liam Neeson gets to be tough guy nearly as impressive as his character
in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;taken-2008&quot;&gt;Taken&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and in a movie nearly as intense. More impressive, however,
is the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Nate_Parker&quot;&gt;Nate Parker&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; performance, whose incredible transformation near
the end of the movie is exciting.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie has some of the best action sequences I&#x27;ve seen yet, as well
as impressive dialog and direction. The visuals are also wonderful
(check the descent of the plane as well as its landing).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do, however, wish:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The acts of the villain were given better justification&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More people should have died, given the rough landing&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Never have I seen the idea of aliens portrayed with such realism. The
attempts at communication is exhilarating, the kind that &lt;em&gt;Contact&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
(1997) gave when I first watched it. Sadly, like that earlier movie, the
movie focuses way too much on the lead... I would have preferred more
attention given to the event. The worst of it is an ability that&#x27;s
revealed towards the movie&#x27;s end. It really takes away from the joy the
movie was. Why do they have to fuck with wonderful movies! Anyways, I
loved the beautiful imagery of the alien writing system, but they could
have made it look less than spheres on fire... at first, I thought they
trying to say that they need a new home due to fucked home planet.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/guardians-of-the-galaxy/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;The most interesting performances:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Michael Rooker, playing Yondu, the leader of the bandits&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chris Pratt, playing the playful lead&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bautista, playing Drax, the heavily-tattooed brute (amazing make-up)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also enjoyed Groot, the tree-like humanoid.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite character design is the lead villain, though I wish the mud
on the face was explained. I also wish he was a more convincing
villain... he needed deeper development than what he gets.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole thing is a lot more whacky than I expected, and does not suit
its epic name. It has lots of humor, and is very entertaining, but I
wish it was less of a passive movie. It also doesn&#x27;t offer anything
new, and the visual effects are merely decent... nothing
ground-breaking here.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;It got some very nice visuals in moments where magic occurs. The dialog
also feels fresh, and I loved the character design of the evil sisters,
which is some of the best I&#x27;ve seen, complete with their animation.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;The movie may be great to look at (look at that house), and Ella Purnell
insanely desirable (she was an adult at the time, I checked), but I
loved the Hollows the most, the invisible monsters that takes the eyes
of Peculiar people.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That bit about eyes is, now thinking about it, rather stupid actually.
It was not even justified in the movie... the writers just jumped to
it, all for the sake of dark.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s nothing new, but it was fun watching &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Kristen_Wiig&quot;&gt;Kristen Wiig&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; oogle over
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Chris_Hemsworth&quot;&gt;Chris Hemsworth&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. I also enjoyed the nerdy performance of &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Neil_Casey&quot;&gt;Neil Casey&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
who plays the villain, and I wish he got more screen time. There is also
a brief performance by the ever-flawless &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Charles_Dance&quot;&gt;Charles Dance&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. My most
favorite though is the super-fresh one of &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Leslie_Jones_%28comedian%29&quot;&gt;Leslie Jones&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;If you can get past the boring setting, you will find an unusual and
entertaining story of a lady that is too stupid to realise that she
can&#x27;t sing. It is also filled with decent performances, but the one
that makes the whole thing worthy of existence is that of &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Simon_Helberg&quot;&gt;Simon
Helberg&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, who is embarrassed by being the pianist for the singer. He&#x27;s
flawless!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/zatoichi-and-the-one-armed-swordsman/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;By the far the most interesting performance is the lead. He pretty much
is the only thing that carries the movie, for the story is rather juvenile
and so is the choreography. There are good moments though, but they all
seem to involve him in the scene, my favorite being when he confronts
the gangsters about an abduction.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only other performance I enjoyed is that of the prostitute that
falls for him. A darker movie with the same character is &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;zatoichi&quot;&gt;Zatoichi&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
(2003).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;good:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The concept of a supreme fighter who also happens to be blind was a
big draw for me. That, and the quality direction, makes for
compelling viewing.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The lead performance is good, but I enjoyed it less that of Shintaro
Katsu when he took the same role in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;zatoichi-and-the-one-armed-swordsman&quot;&gt;Zatoichi and the One-Armed
Swordsman&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (1971).&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;bad:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The geisha story received too much attention... it was done well
and touching, but also mostly boring.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The crazy guy running around with a spear is too annoying.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The violence inflicted by the lead was too often excessive... he
killed too easily.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;The squabbling and delegation of decision-making seen in the movie was
most entertaining, and also unique in my movie-watching experience,
complete with high-tension and interesting debates. The most admirable
character is the guy who operates the insect-sized drone.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am, however, sad due to some of the shortcuts taken, all regarding the
country the movie is set in:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The movie is set in Kenya, but there&#x27;s way too many South African
actors, a fact that could perhaps be forgiven since filming took
place in that country&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am told that the unhygienic handling of bread doesn&#x27;t happen in
Kenya&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No terrorist organisation controls any part of Kenya&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Possibly the most violent movie I&#x27;ve yet seen, this is made in the
style of video game first person shooters. I enjoyed the wonderful
performances: the villain was especially menacing, and the guide, given
multiple characters, was given an excellent performance by &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Sharlto_Copley&quot;&gt;Sharlto
Copley&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, in what is his most satisfying work since &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;district-9&quot;&gt;District 9&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. The
story is also fascinating and so is the technology.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Am not a fan of highly complicated action sequences, though luckily they
weren&#x27;t too long or loud in here. I also enjoyed the title character
before being transformed into a sorcerer, reminding me of the excellent
Dr House (the tv series), and also given a good performance. I did,
however, find his transformation into a great sorcerer rushed. The
bargaining scene was interesting, though I wish the set was a lot less
cartoonish. There were some other stupid things, like the sorcerers
running around chasing each other, when they had the powers to control
objects by mere willpower, one of those &amp;quot;why the fuck didn&#x27;t you do
that in the first place&amp;quot; moments. I wish the black shit on the faces of the
evil sorcerers should have been explained as well... it looks so
stupid, like kids playing with mud.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

last car chase too lengthy and uninteresting, father-was-involved story
silly, CIA director played by a boring actor, and that SWAT car is way
too resilient.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;When the movie does not take shortcuts with the story (the villain is
too skilled in science&#x2F;engineering and also too strong; the Don Cheadle
character was able to use the suit without training), or being
annoyingly-stupid (why the fuck did Pepper Potts drive with bodyguard to
deliver the suit), it gets the delightful direction and dialog of &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;iron-man&quot;&gt;its
predecessor&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. The rivalry between Stark and Hammer is lots of fun to watch.
The villain is also fun to watch, even though his motivations were given
lazy treatment. All three are given very good performances.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <pubDate>Sat, 07 May 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
                <link>http://tshepang.net/2015-review/</link>
                <guid>http://tshepang.net/2015-review/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;The best &lt;strong&gt;visual effects&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; can be found in the Hulk vs. Hulkbuster
battle of &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;avengers-age-of-ultron&quot;&gt;Avengers: Age of Ultron&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Runner-up is the title character of
&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;chappie&quot;&gt;Chappie&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. The greatest &lt;strong&gt;spectacle&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;jurassic-world&quot;&gt;Jurassic World&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, whose visual
effects aren&#x27;t shabby either.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best &lt;strong&gt;direction&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; can be found in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-survivalist&quot;&gt;The Survivalist&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, followed by
&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;spotlight&quot;&gt;Spotlight&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, which itself boasts best &lt;strong&gt;editing&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;dialog&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My &lt;strong&gt;favorite performance&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is that of Benedict Wong in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-martian&quot;&gt;The Martian&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
while my &lt;strong&gt;favorite villain&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is Scarlet, the lead villain of &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;minions&quot;&gt;Minions&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.
That movie also boasts best &lt;strong&gt;visual design&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. My &lt;strong&gt;favorite character&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;
is Ultron, the lead villain in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;avengers-age-of-ultron&quot;&gt;Avengers: Age of Ultron&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. The most
&lt;strong&gt;desirable gal&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is Sonoya Mizuno in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;ex-machina&quot;&gt;Ex Machina&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, which also happens
to have the &lt;strong&gt;best dialog&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <title>Avengers: Age of Ultron</title>
                <pubDate>Sat, 07 May 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
                <link>http://tshepang.net/avengers-age-of-ultron/</link>
                <guid>http://tshepang.net/avengers-age-of-ultron/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;I was not so impressed when I saw this one first time:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am afraid that the producers of the franchise are losing the plot a
little. The movie is entertaining enough, but I kept feeling it&#x27;s too
much of a money-making machine. The plot is rather messy, and the
action overly-frantic. I much prefer &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-avengers-2012&quot;&gt;the original&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did, however, love something in it:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite moment is the battle between Hulk and the super-sized Iron
Man. It&#x27;s a showcase of visual effects mastery, and what makes it
extra special is the setting... South Africa.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still do love the scene, but I love the villain even more. The writers
did a great job to demonstrate the fact that this character is a
super-intelligence, making him quite unusual and unpredictable,
resulting in it being unlike any character I&#x27;ve ever seen. I love his
various appearances: birth, broken robot, first meeting with the twins,
the severed arm, and the self-killing (in which he occupies a more
shitty body).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <title>Captain America: Civil War</title>
                <pubDate>Sun, 01 May 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
                <link>http://tshepang.net/captain-america-civil-war/</link>
                <guid>http://tshepang.net/captain-america-civil-war/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;I really, really love the new character, Black Panther, as well as the
performance. The suit is amazing and so is the fighting style. He easily
is the most interesting character in the movie. I do wish that his
background was given more attention though (how did he learn to fight so
well, and how did he manage to own a suit that amazing).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Runner-up is Winter Soldier, who was also the most interesting character
of the previous movie in the series, &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;captain-america-the-winter-soldier-2014&quot;&gt;Captain America: Winter Soldier&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 3-person fight near the end was something special, though its
motivation was not very believable. It was rather dark for the movie,
and steers too far from what we&#x27;ve come to learn about the characters.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like so many big action movies, the movies suffers from over-complexity
of the plot and action sequences, making it harder to follow and
appreciate. It doesn&#x27;t help that it had a ridiculous number of
characters, including 2 surprise additions. Having colorful characters
can be exciting, but they simply were not needed for the story.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Great direction and editing work serve well this highly-entertaining story
about sexual abuses of Catholic priests. The characters are interesting
and impressively bold (see the new editor) and are given superb dialog.
Their commitment to the stories they tell is also admirable. What is sad
is that they are superior to the (admittedly competent) performances
they are offered.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/the-survivalist/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Amazing direction kept one absorbed throughout the movie, even given
the numerous slow&#x2F;quiet moments. The acting is also decent and the
story, though minimal, exciting. The opening scene, that of the 2
graphs, is very scary, offering a good intro.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/deadpool/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;I found this the most fun (lots and lots of good humor) of all superhero
movies I&#x27;ve yet seen. I&#x27;m also tempted to call it the best, but a
revisit is required before dethroning &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;iron-man&quot;&gt;Iron Man&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; from that position. I
find it the most daring (the vulgarity), and has a great number of movie
firsts. In addition, the action direction is superb, and so are the
visual effects. The movie also offers some of the most delicious
instances of Breaking the Fourth Wall. I am also glad that the character
of Colossus (man of metal) was changed... the X-Men movies did a bad
job with theirs.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complaints:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wish the romantic interest was less of an action hero herself,
just to lend a bit of realism, as well as avoiding the
super-annoying formula.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Near the end of the movie, tough lady simply disappears without
explanation.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s a rare experience for me to watch a movie after reading the novel
it&#x27;s based on. There are so many comparisons, and those can result in
complaints. Anyways, this was a reasonably faithful adaptation, and also
very respectful one; there are many moments where things from the novel
occur briefly even though they don&#x27;t really add to the story.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one performance that I enjoyed, which happens to be superior to all
others, is that of &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.imdb.com&#x2F;name&#x2F;nm0938950&quot;&gt;Benedict Wong&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. He felt amazingly realistic, and was
presented a very loving and admirable character. No one else impressed
me, and that includes the acclaimed one of Matt Damon in the leading
role.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;This year was rather sad: I didn&#x27;t see any fresh movie (movies I saw
first time) above &lt;strong&gt;good&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; rating (5&#x2F;7). That is, there wasn&#x27;t anything
at the excellent level (6&#x2F;7), never mind a masterpiece (7&#x2F;7). That also
means nothing stood out enough to be labeled &lt;strong&gt;best movie of the year&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;.
Regardless, there was still much to celebrate. Let&#x27;s see.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;visuals&quot;&gt;visuals&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best &lt;strong&gt;production design&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;doubt-2008&quot;&gt;Doubt&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, followed by &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-iceman-2012&quot;&gt;The Iceman&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best &lt;strong&gt;visual design&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;upside-down-2012&quot;&gt;Upside Down&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, followed by &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-hunger-games-catching-fire-2013&quot;&gt;The Hunger
Games: Catching Fire&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best &lt;strong&gt;cinematography&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;doubt-2008&quot;&gt;Doubt&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, also followed by &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-iceman-2012&quot;&gt;The
Iceman&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best &lt;strong&gt;visual effects&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; are in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;thor-the-dark-world-2013&quot;&gt;Thor: The Dark World&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, followed by

&lt;h1 id=&quot;performances&quot;&gt;performances&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My &lt;strong&gt;favorite performance&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is by &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.imdb.com&#x2F;name&#x2F;nm4030776&quot;&gt;Laurence R. Harvey&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; as the disgusting

&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;best female performance&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; was given by &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Susanne_Lothar&quot;&gt;Susanne Lothar&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;funny-games-1997&quot;&gt;Funny

&lt;p&gt;My &lt;strong&gt;favorite character&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is the adoptive father in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-book-thief-2013&quot;&gt;The Book Thief&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
played by Geoffrey Rush. He&#x27;s followed by the charming China Doll in
&lt;em&gt;Oz the Great and Powerful&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, which is about as cute and lovable as
characters get. In third place is Valka, the mother of the lead
character in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;how-to-train-your-dragon-2-2014&quot;&gt;How To Train Your Dragon 2&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most &lt;strong&gt;desirable gal&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Dania_Ramirez&quot;&gt;Dania Ramirez&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;premium-rush-2012&quot;&gt;Premium Rush&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was no better &lt;strong&gt;character design&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; than the giant samurai robot in
&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-wolverine-2013&quot;&gt;The Wolverine&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. In second place is the Alpha dragon from &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;how-to-train-your-dragon-2-2014&quot;&gt;How To Train
Your Dragon 2&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;miscellaneous&quot;&gt;miscellaneous&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was no &lt;strong&gt;direction&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; better than &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;funny-games-1997&quot;&gt;Funny Games&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,

                <title>Her</title>
                <pubDate>Mon, 18 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
                <link>http://tshepang.net/her/</link>
                <guid>http://tshepang.net/her/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;The movie is beautifully-shot, well-edited, and has an exciting concept.
On first viewing, the experience of the first 30 minutes or so was so
magical that I was led to think this may turn out to be at least
excellent. Sadly that wasn&#x27;t the case: feels like the writer didn&#x27;t
know where to take the story, or even how to end it. The direction style
feels similar to &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;tree-of-life-2011&quot;&gt;Tree of Life&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, only a lot less experimental, and a lot
more entertaining. A revisit resulted in something that felt rather thin
and boring.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite performance is that of Olivia Wilde. I&#x27;ve only enjoyed her
once before, &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;in-time-2011&quot;&gt;In Time&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and I&#x27;ve seen her in a few other places as
well, most notably the good-to-excellent TV series, &lt;em&gt;House&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. In all
that, she has never been this good (see the heartbreak moment), and this
desirable. It&#x27;s also a brief performance, a fact that&#x27;s probably in
her favor, given she&#x27;s not the most excellent of actors.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Fascinating, with an eery feel that&#x27;s accentuated by the overly loud
and uncomfortable score, it also possesses wonderful direction and
dialog. Performances are also good, most impressive of which is the
lead, though &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.imdb.com&#x2F;name&#x2F;nm4420495&quot;&gt;Sonoya Mizuno&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, playing food&#x2F;sex servant, offered the most
pleasure to the eye, especially when dancing. She&#x27;s so perfect.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/the-mechanic/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;A stupid story, with two things worthy of mention:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The giant gay hitman has quite a presence, reminding me of the great
&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;John_Carroll_Lynch&quot;&gt;John Carroll Lynch&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Equally impressive is the fat guy playing a self-proclaimed messiah.
Both these characters were surprisingly weel-developed.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/minions/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;I never liked the Minions from the time they were introduced, so I
didn&#x27;t expect to enjoy this, so it was a pleasant surprise to find this
movie better than the two previous ones. I thought it would be a tired
attempt at milking the franchise, but it turned out a good execution of
the concept of characters who derive purpose from serving villains.
Speaking of those, the lead villain is such a pleasure to watch,
together with the husband. Both are works of great character design and
animation. Their home is also a work of great visual design... it looks
amazing. I wish it was explored more.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a rather unusual and very well-made Bourne-style movie. It also
had the best hand-to-hand combat scenes I&#x27;ve seen outside of martial
arts movies. I wish the lead actor had more training, for her lack of
skill show near the end. All other performances are solid, luckily.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/jurassic-world/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Though the story is shallow and full of shortcuts, the movie is very
enjoyable and got lots of exciting moments. &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Chris_Pratt&quot;&gt;Chris Pratt&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, whose appeal
surprised me in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;guardians-of-the-galaxy&quot;&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, also gives a nice performance
here, though none tops the humorous one of &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Irrfan_Khan&quot;&gt;Irrfan Khan&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. I was also
pleased to see &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Omar_Sy&quot;&gt;Omar Sy&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; again (saw him first time in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;good-people-2014&quot;&gt;Good People&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/the-man-from-earth/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;For a movie that is almost entirely made of dialog, this is exciting.
It&#x27;s also the first time I saw the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tony_Todd&quot;&gt;Tony Todd&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; play an ordinary
character, which he does very well.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish there would be more restraint: the overreaction by some of the
characters was ludicrous and felt forced, and the Jesus part even worse.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;movie-of-the-year&quot;&gt;movie of the year&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;cloverfield-2008&quot;&gt;Cloverfield&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is the year&#x27;s greatest spectacle, with the inventive
style popularised by &lt;em&gt;The Blair Witch Project&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, and sweetened with the
year&#x27;s best visual effects and superb sound. An honorable mention goes
to &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;taken-2008&quot;&gt;Taken&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;best-movie&quot;&gt;best movie&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;children-of-men-2006&quot;&gt;Children of Men&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; easily takes this one.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;direction&quot;&gt;direction&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing was done better than &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;children-of-men-2006&quot;&gt;Children of Men&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, followed by &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;no-country-for-old-men-2007&quot;&gt;No Country
for Old Men&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;misc-elements&quot;&gt;misc elements&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best comedy is &lt;em&gt;Knocked Up&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, and nothing was quite as enchanting as the
feel-good socio-political &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;recent-movies-2008-05-19&quot;&gt;Hairspray&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. The runner-up is the formulaic,
yet effective, &lt;em&gt;Robots&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing made me cry in my history of movie-watching as did the drama,
&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;kinsey-2004&quot;&gt;Kinsey&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and there wasn&#x27;t a movie as bizarre as &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;persona-1966&quot;&gt;Persona&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, while the
year&#x27;s best dialogue can be found in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;recent-movies-2008-11-06&quot;&gt;The Squid &amp;amp; the Whale&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for production design, nothing beat &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;no-country-for-old-men-2007&quot;&gt;No Country for Old Men&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, while
&lt;em&gt;TMNT&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is a runner-up, animated as it is. &lt;em&gt;No Country for Old Men&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; also
got the year&#x27;s best sound, followed by a tie between &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;recent-movies-2008-02-01&quot;&gt;30 Days of Night&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
and &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;cloverfield-2008&quot;&gt;Cloverfield&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-new-world-2005&quot;&gt;The New World&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&#x27;s editing is the year&#x27;s most
accomplished.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best dancing can be found in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;recent-movies-2008-12-15&quot;&gt;Step Up 2: The Streets&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, there&#x27;s no
better action-thriller than &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;taken-2008&quot;&gt;Taken&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (followed by &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;shooter-2007&quot;&gt;Shooter&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;), while no
horror is better than the chilling &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;recent-movies-2008-06-26&quot;&gt;Vacancy&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. The best action is found
in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;final-fantasy-vii-advent-children-2005&quot;&gt;Final Fantasy VII - Advent Children&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, followed by &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;kung-fu-panda-2008&quot;&gt;Kung Fu Panda&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.
The best fight is between the characters played by Jet Li and Jacky Chan
in the otherwise shitty and silly &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;recent-movies-2008-10-12&quot;&gt;The Forbidden Kingdom&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;misc-small-things&quot;&gt;misc small things&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The year&#x27;s best escape was the villain&#x27;s in &lt;em&gt;Kung Fu Panda&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, followed
by that from the &#x27;safe house&#x27; in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;children-of-men-2006&quot;&gt;Children of Men&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, which also happens
to have the best battle scene. The best confrontation was that of the
characters of Craig Bierko and Russel Crowe in a party scene in &lt;em&gt;The
Cinderella Man&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. The best end-credits sequence can be seen in &lt;em&gt;The
Mummy&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, which uses a concept copied from &lt;em&gt;300&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&#x27;s end-credits sequence.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Condemned&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; had my favorite sexual interaction (very brief but
complete with beautiful comic touches) and I don&#x27;t remember a car crash
in movie history as great as that in &lt;em&gt;Death Proof&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;performances&quot;&gt;performances&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The year&#x27;s performance is easily Heath Ledger&#x27;s in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-dark-knight-2008&quot;&gt;The Dark Knight&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
and he happens to be the movie&#x27;s sole redeemer, almost. Other
outstanding male performers are Josh Brolin in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;planet-terror-2007&quot;&gt;Planet Terror&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, Cuba
Gooding, Jr.&#x27;s as dirty cop in &lt;em&gt;Dirty&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, John Carrol Lynch&#x27;s bit
appearance in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;confidence-2002&quot;&gt;Confidence&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and then Stanley Tucci&#x27;s fashion lover in
&lt;em&gt;The Devil Wears Prada&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. My favorite comic performance is William H.
Macy&#x27;s in &lt;em&gt;Wild Hogs&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best female performance was by Cate Blanchett&#x27;s title character as
a daring journalist in &lt;em&gt;Veronica Guerin&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, followed by the surprisingly
excellent Kerry Washington as a slutty girl in &lt;em&gt;I Think I Love My Wife&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.
Ger Ryan (2nd runner-up) really touched me as a loving mother in
&lt;em&gt;interMission&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; followed by Ellen Barkin (3rd runner-up) in &lt;em&gt;Someone Like
You&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. That Ger Ryan also ties with Ellen Page&#x27;s appearance in the
horrifying &lt;em&gt;Hard Candy&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; as my favorite female performance. They are
followed by Clare-Hope Ashitey&#x27;s key role in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;children-of-men-2006&quot;&gt;Children of Men&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and then
a tie (2nd runner-up) between Katie Holmes&#x27; thief in &lt;em&gt;Mad Money&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and
Q&#x27;Orianka Kilcher&#x27;s Pocahontas in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-new-world-2005&quot;&gt;The New World&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. The best bit-female
performance is Alexandra Silber&#x27;s book lover in &lt;em&gt;Room 1408&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; which is
the best thing in the movie even though she appears in just one short
scene.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best cast is a tie between &lt;em&gt;interMission&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; (a bunch of memorable and
eccentric characters) and &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;no-country-for-old-men-2007&quot;&gt;No Country for Old Men&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (a small solid set of
rural American characters). The runner-ups is a tie between &lt;em&gt;Friends
With Money&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; (very honest and fresh performances) and &lt;em&gt;The Lookout&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. The
best characterisations was in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-new-world-2005&quot;&gt;The New World&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for the colorful portrayal
of the Native Americans.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;characters&quot;&gt;characters&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;best villain&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is Heath Ledger&#x27;s The Joker in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-dark-knight-2008&quot;&gt;The Dark Knight&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
who is also my most favorite ever. He is followed by Sid Haig&#x27;s
homorous clown in &lt;em&gt;House of A Thousand Corpses&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most desirable gal is Emelia Burns, the black girl in &lt;em&gt;The
Condemned&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. She&#x27;s followed by Cate Blanchett in &lt;em&gt;Veronica Guerin&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and
then Shirley Henderson as the emotionally-hurt girl in &lt;em&gt;interMission&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were no characters as cute the young penguins in &lt;em&gt;Surf&#x27;s Up&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My most &lt;strong&gt;favorite creature&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is the super-large monster in
&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;cloverfield-2008&quot;&gt;Cloverfield&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, followed by Pyramid Head in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;silent-hill-2006&quot;&gt;Silent Hill&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. 2nd runner-up
is the hyper-realistic mountain creatures in &lt;em&gt;The Mummy 3&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. The best
&lt;strong&gt;character design&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; however goes to the villainous Maltazard in &lt;em&gt;Arthur
&amp;amp; the Invisibles&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, followed by the three suits in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;iron-man&quot;&gt;Iron Man&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;visuals&quot;&gt;visuals&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The year&#x27;s most beautiful imagery can be found in &lt;em&gt;Surf&#x27;s Up&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; (the
waves and the hidden beach), with an honorable mention going to &lt;em&gt;The
Bank Job&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, especially its opening scene. &lt;em&gt;Appleseed&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; has the year&#x27;s
best visuals.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Not quite as good as on first viewing (it felt a hell of a lot of fresh
back when I watched it in 2008), but it remains entertaining. I
especially love the performance of &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Frances_McDormand&quot;&gt;Frances McDormand&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, followed by
&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.imdb.com&#x2F;name&#x2F;nm0564402&quot;&gt;Simon McBurney&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; who plays her husband.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;The best &lt;strong&gt;action&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; can be found in the fight scenes of &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;non-stop&quot;&gt;Non-Stop&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, but
the best &lt;strong&gt;visual effects&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; are in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;dracula-untold&quot;&gt;Dracula Untold&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. The best
&lt;strong&gt;animation&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;big-hero-6&quot;&gt;Big Hero 6&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, a movie that also has my &lt;strong&gt;favorite
character&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;, the inflatable robot.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;One of those movies which choose not to distinguish themselves at all in
terms of story (so shallow, though I do like the vampire re-imagining)
and direction (nothing new), but it is entertaining at least. It also
got great visual effects and amazing make-up work, not to mention a
wonderful performance from the great &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Charles_Dance&quot;&gt;Charles Dance&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Hugh Jackman did a good job here, more impressive the anything else
he&#x27;s done before. It&#x27;s a pity that his character goes too far into
unconvincing territory where its obsession leads it to do something as
stupid as de-activating the helpful robots. But even more interesting is
the title character: it&#x27;s humorous, enchanting, and also well-animated
(invisible visual effects). None of the characters are given any depth.
Regardless, the movie is captivating, and has a great ending, fairy tale
as it is.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/iron-man/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;The best superhero movie made so far, I was amazed it held its
entertainment value after a few revisits.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The relaxed and superb performance of Robert Downey, Jr.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The charming performance of Gwyneth Paltrow&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The unique performance of &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Clark_Gregg&quot;&gt;Clark Gregg&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The great designs of the Iron Man suit, and all related visual
effects&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The laid-back humor (first scene being the best example)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bad:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;None of the villains are any interesting&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wish the main villain had a bit of practice before managing to use
the giant suit with such competence&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The hero manages to fool his captors of what he&#x27;s building for a
long time, especially given that he&#x27;s under camera surveillance&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He also survives way too much physical pounding&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&#x27;ll wish the filmmakers would invest as much in plausibility and
common sense as in the gorgeous suits on display here.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really hated these bad things on the first revisit, but they were easy
to overlook this time around... the good stuff managed to distract me well
enough.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;My favorite moment is in the beginning of the movie, where the lead
character meets one disrespectful guy. What makes it more fun is what
is revealed soon after, that he&#x27;s not actually in control. The rest of the
movie is also enjoyable, and remains so even on a revisit. It&#x27;s made
all the more fascinating by being based on actual events.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I found the creature design of the dragon amazing, best dragon design
I&#x27;ve yet seen. Most everything else is stale, though I do love the
giants. The combat moments were annoying, where you see puny creatures
stand their own against the fearsome beasts. I wish these beasts were
given more than cardboard characters, given that they clearly were
intelligent beings.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;The movie is overall well-made and got a story that feels fresh, and one
that&#x27;s seldom told: people taking video footage of gruesome events. The
scene that culminates in a police car chase is intense and feels
realistic... great direction and camerawork.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jake Gyllenhaal, the lead of the quality cast, is a highly skilled actor
(see &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;prisoners-2013&quot;&gt;Prisoners&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;zodiac-and-david-fincher&quot;&gt;Zodiac&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;), but I haven&#x27;t seen him this good. His
character is very unusual and scary, and pretty much a supreme asshole
you wish didn&#x27;t exist. His life is shit (he&#x27;s lonely, out of money,
and seems to have some mental problem), so I almost don&#x27;t blame him for
his criminal behavior.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rene Russo also gives a great performance, and so does the lady
portraying the detective, Michael Hyatt. The latter is very imposing,
and pretty much towers above everyone in her (few and short-lived)
scenes. &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;top-movie-characters#tough-women&quot;&gt;Great toughness portrayal&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; there.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <title>I Am Legend</title>

                <description>&lt;p&gt;It offers among the most impressive sets in movie history: a Manhattan
so deserted that lions and impalas walk its streets. The city is also
filled with rusting vehicles, including military tanks and planes. Too
kool.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emma Thompson, though appearing briefly, does offer the movie&#x27;s most
electrifying performance. Will Smith, on the other hand, shows a great
lack of acting skills, and is even embarrassing at times. He is,
however, interesting enough to lead the story well.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;The level of fantasy in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;cloudy-with-a-chance-of-meatballs-2009&quot;&gt;Cloudy With A Chance of Meatballs&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; went to
ridiculous levels, but this one is even worse. As was the case with
&lt;em&gt;Cloudy&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, it started very well, mostly with the help of the cute, chubby,
and funny air-filled robot, but devolves into super-lazy writing with
too many holes, and an overly-skilled teenage engineer. Making things
worse is some bad recycled plot points, an example being the apologetic
moment our (very uninteresting) lead character gets to have after doing
something unbearably stupid. All this spoils the various good spots the
movie offers.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <title>Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows</title>
                <pubDate>Thu, 05 Mar 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Robert Downey Jr. is a lot of fun to watch, and Stephen Fry
plays the most interesting character in the movie. I also enjoyed &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Jared_Harris&quot;&gt;Jared
Harris&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, whose villain character offers superb rivalry with that of the
lead. It&#x27;s my most favorite of his performances (though I wish his
character didn&#x27;t sing). Also, I have never seen &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Kelly_Reilly&quot;&gt;Kelly Reilly&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; this
desirable. The visual effects are at times eye-popping (see the escape
from the military). It&#x27;s fun watching Sherlock do his impossible
deductions.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some tiny problems:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This may be a fantasy, but the action is too unrealistic.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jude Law is not so interesting, and felt a bit miscast.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The gypsy sister kept hanging around seemingly without much purpose
really, and the story involving her and her brother is not so
interesting.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed the movie a lot better than its predecessor, and it&#x27;s even
better on a revisit.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;My bad memory tells me that this is the first pro-socialist movie I&#x27;ve
yet seen. It&#x27;s also well-made, well-written, and got very good
performances, my favorite being the mother of the lead character. It
feels like an accurate description of what socialist strive would look
like.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <title>2009 movie review</title>
                <pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
                <link>http://tshepang.net/2009-movie-review/</link>
                <guid>http://tshepang.net/2009-movie-review/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;The year started with a whole lot of stellar performers but slowed down
later on since I did things other than watch movies. Regardless, that
early period represented some of the best movie years in recent memory.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;best-movie&quot;&gt;best movie&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The year&#x27;s best movie is &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;baise-moi-2000&quot;&gt;Baise-moi&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, whose unflinching and unsettling
violence has the raw intensity of &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;bamboozled-2000&quot;&gt;Bamboozled&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&#x27;s climax and the
harshness of &lt;em&gt;Natural Born Killers&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, without the humor.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;performances&quot;&gt;performances&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite performances are a tie and all go to one movie, &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;watchmen-2009&quot;&gt;Watchmen&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
+++ Jeffrey Dean Morgan as The Comedian and Jackie Earle Haley when face
is unmasked. Runner-up is &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Raffa%C3%ABla_Anderson&quot;&gt;Raffaëla Anderson&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; as a crazed rape victim in

&lt;p&gt;There was quite a number of superb male performances, the best being
Daniel-Day Lewis&#x27; near-flawless performances as oil miner in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;there-will-be-blood-2007&quot;&gt;There
Will Be Blood&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Here&#x27;s the runner-ups:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John Malkovich as activist in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;changeling-2008&quot;&gt;Changeling&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jack Nicholson as grumpy tycoon in &lt;em&gt;Bucket List&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The year&#x27;s &lt;strong&gt;best female performance&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is a tie between that Rosario
Dawson&#x27;s as the love interest in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;recent-movies-2009-04-14&quot;&gt;Seven Pounds&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and Tilda Swinton&#x27;s
as fleeting lover in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;fincher-s-most-pointless-yet&quot;&gt;The Curious Case of Benjamin Button&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;characters&quot;&gt;characters&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to last year, this year is lacklustre, except for desirable
gals where Golshifteh Farahani (&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;recent-movies-2009-04-14&quot;&gt;Body of Lies&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;) and husky

the warrior girl in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;avatar-2009&quot;&gt;Avatar&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, who&#x2F;which also happens to be year&#x27;s
&lt;strong&gt;best creature&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Character design goes to the talking toys of &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;small-soldiers-1998&quot;&gt;Small Soldiers&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;most touching&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; movie (overall) is &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;yellow-earth-1984&quot;&gt;Yellow Earth&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, a sad
exploration of a hopeless yearning for freedom, which presents itself in
a form of Communist soldier with a weird mission. The &lt;strong&gt;most touching
moments&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is the relationship between the Chinese and Russian lady in
&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;more-of-jia&quot;&gt;The World&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, followed by a childish romance between silly tent

                <title>Wreck-It Ralph (2012)</title>

                <description>&lt;p&gt;A highly-enjoyable fantasy about a bad-guy video game character who
yearns for some loving. His acting on this desire, however, messes
things up since he was designed to be villain. Along the way, he meets a
delightful character in a form of computer glitch, an outcast that he
reluctantly befriends.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole thing is typical Disney, but it&#x27;s all good formula. The
animation is good (check the racing cars and the high-resolution game)
and the story enchanting, and it&#x27;s all predictable of course.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;It has good direction and acting (I&#x27;ve never seen &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tom_Wilkinson&quot;&gt;Tom Wilkinson&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; this
good, and I enjoyed watching the ultra-cool &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Omar_Sy&quot;&gt;Omar Sy&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;). But, it&#x27;s yet
another example of a well-made movie that ends not so well. It&#x27;s too
smart and fresh for such improbable things to happen, worst of which was
having the detective drive into a bad guy just-in-time. Regardless, the
critics gave it more hate than it deserved.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <title>The Fault in Our Stars (2014)</title>
                <pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
                <link>http://tshepang.net/the-fault-in-our-stars-2014/</link>
                <guid>http://tshepang.net/the-fault-in-our-stars-2014/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;The most exciting moment is the encounter with the author of the a
favorite book of the leading character. It was quite intense, and rather
surprising, though not entirely unpredictable. Willem Dafoe gives the
character some justice, even though the characterization feels recycled,
some sort of a caricature.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides that, this is yet another movie that starts off well and fucks
up later on. The fuck-up this time around happens around halfway through
the movie, which is around the end of the Amsterdam trip. The rest of it
drags on, and just feel overlong. I even got tired of watching the
leading lady, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Shailene_Woodley&quot;&gt;Shailene Woodley&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, despite her excellent performance.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <title>How To Train Your Dragon 2 (2014)</title>
                <pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
                <link>http://tshepang.net/how-to-train-your-dragon-2-2014/</link>
                <guid>http://tshepang.net/how-to-train-your-dragon-2-2014/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;I loved the character design of the mother, and that includes both the
look and movements. She was even better when masked, possessing
awe-inspiring presence, a feeling enhanced by her great skill with the
dragons. &#x27;Her&#x27; dragons, which are newer designs from those from &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;how-to-train-your-dragon-2010&quot;&gt;the
earlier movie&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, also received great design, most impressive of which is
the Alpha. Exploring the home of these dragons was quite an experience,
which is weird, given the careless character design elsewhere (e.g. most
of the human characters). The epic feel is among the greatest I&#x27;ve
experienced of any movie.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie is full of quality humor. Among my favorites is the romantic
attraction expressed by the girl for the new guy. It&#x27;s recycled stuff,
but well executed. There was also good humor (and charms) from the
dragons; check how playful they are with each other.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish more time was spent with the mother, since she is easily the most
interesting character in the movie. Instead, she&#x27;s later reduced to a
secondary character, and not even instrumental in the victory her son
emerges from. Also, the writers mostly neglected the promise she made to
teach this son about the dragons. Instead the movie rushes too quickly
to the son (and his dragon) being pretty much the sole hero of the
movie. So shallow, so sad. Wasted opportunity.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

                <description>&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s surprising to have a movie with A-list starts be this wacky. It&#x27;s
exciting and feels fresh for the first 30 minutes or so, right up until
the moment the lead character, Lucy, gets the drugs removed from inside
her. The phone call to mommy was especially wonderful. The villain was
also very scary. Most of the rest is gibberish, bordering on stupid. By
the time the whole thing ends, I was tempted to call the move bad, but
there&#x27;s still that first 30 minutes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One other thing to praise was the WTF that Morgan Freeman expressed on
the first phone call to this Lucy character. I don&#x27;t recall such a
level of wonderment in all of my movie-watching experience (but I have
shitty memory).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story concept is similar to that of &lt;em&gt;Limitless&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, but with far less
restraint, and a much lesser script.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Exciting ride, all until the too-implausible elimination of the villain.
Could have been better if the humans lost actually, instead of the lazy
resolution, where the two heroes receive way too much pounding. The
enemy was also too advanced (faster, bigger, and better weaponry) for
them to make through that final showdown. Everywhere else if fine,
because the two heroes get multiple opportunities against this
impressive enemy. I also wish the enemy was explored more. The
single-super-villain-controls-all-others thing is just too stupid and
recycled (think &lt;em&gt;Independence Day&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;). and not worthy of a quality
offering such as this gem. Not even Tom Cruise is a blemish, and the
visual effects are supreme, even though they were showcased mainly at
the beginning.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Geoffrey Rush gives a very touching performance as a kindly guardian of a
girl who lost her family. He is as loving a character as I&#x27;ve seen in
any movie. Emily Watson also shines as the angry wife. Both performances
are flawless, and the movie feels like a weird and horrid fable. It&#x27;s
not a pleasant watch, especially the second half.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Intensely brutal story about a United States where, on one night of the
year, murder is made legal. It&#x27;s a fresh idea, and is executed well,
though a bit over-the-top at times. It&#x27;s also not a plausible idea, or
rather, it deserved better justification.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The performances are of decent quality, best of which are the rich
characters near the end, who view killing others as entertainment. My
favorite, though brief, is the leader of those who deliver the victims
to these rich killers: scary, yet somewhat sympathetic.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s the best in the series so far, but I don&#x27;t really see an
improvement in visual effects over &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;transformers-dark-of-the-moon-2011&quot;&gt;its predecessor&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. I&#x27;m guessing
that&#x27;s because &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;transformers-2007&quot;&gt;the first movie in the series&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; set a ridiculously high
bar. In keeping to tradition, the movie is also noisy and has
overly-frantic action (WTF&#x27;s going on), and has way too much of it. It
also has a shallow story-line and none of the characters are very
interesting. Luckily, there is no &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tyrese_Gibson&quot;&gt;Tyrese Gibson&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Josh_Duhamel&quot;&gt;Josh Duhamel&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to
help spoil things. There is also no mention of why these primary human
characters were so drastically changed... sad.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie is entertaining throughout, despite running for over 150
minutes. The evil Transformers were scarily-violent, as they always were
in this series. The scariest of them, Megatron, was pretty much cast
aside in this movie.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/children-of-men-2006/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;The nightmarish way of life portrayed here is about as dark as it gets.
The performances are great and so are the characters:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The lady that can&#x27;t speak English is touching; I also loved the
nurse&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Character played by Clive Owen is relentlessly heroic&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The pregnant lady is charming, and is the most interesting in the
movie; she&#x27;s played by &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.imdb.com&#x2F;name&#x2F;nm1715135&quot;&gt;Clare-Hope Ashitey&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Julianne Moore freedom fighter is wonderful, and is given the
usual excellent performance the actor is know for&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only character I could have done without is that played by Michael
Caine. He felt recycled, and was somewhat not believable. It was still
heartbreaking when he had to meet his killers though.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie features some of the best battle scenes I&#x27;ve seen, a fact
made more impressive due to the fact this isn&#x27;t a war movie. The
direction is also about as good as it gets. The story is quite unusual
and unpredictable, which gives the whole thing a fresh feeling. I still
wish there was more of an explanation of what the fuck fucked UK so bad.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <title>Fight Club (1999)</title>
                <pubDate>Sun, 05 Oct 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
                <link>http://tshepang.net/fight-club-1999/</link>

                <description>&lt;p&gt;What would one say when reviewing what one considers superior to all
other works of its kind? Following is a (lackluster) attempt.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie remains engaging after all these years and repeat viewings
(maybe 10 times). If feels modern as any movie made today, all except
for the lack of cellphones, and a presence of a CRT television set.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s not perfect, and I wish to see something to dethrone it. Here&#x27;s
what I don&#x27;t like:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tyler Durden manages to stand up after a bullet makes it through his
throat. He can even talk normal, and gives a comfortable hug.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The beating the lead character gets near the end feels so needless,
and it&#x27;s not even interesting (enough to make up for its uselessness).&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My least favorite moment is when the lead gives himself a beating in
front of his boss. Boring.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like everything else, and no movie has superior direction, production
design, and cinematography. The cast is great too and so is the editing.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#x27;s an old review:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boasts all-time best direction, cinematography, &amp;amp; sound editing; a
supremely intriguing storyline which is so rich it could be made
into 2 or 3 other features; the entire set-design and acting
convinces me that Fincher, besides being the best, is also more
attentive to detail than perhaps all others... there&#x27;s no bad
physics, no classic movie mistakes, no overuse of visual
effects... this resulting in a visually- and mentally-stimulating
masterpiece. Its technical and artistic perfection blows my mind
away.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <pubDate>Sat, 04 Oct 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
                <link>http://tshepang.net/the-expendables-3/</link>
                <guid>http://tshepang.net/the-expendables-3/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;I liked a few things:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I do not remember enjoying Antonio Banderas this much; his character
and performance are superior to all others (not hard) in the movie.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I initially felt that Mel Gibson was miscast as villain, but he
proved worthy: a fearsome personality (well-developed, and deserving
a better movie) and a really good performance.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I enjoyed watching Dolph Lundgren; he gives a decent, humorous
performance.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jet Li and Arnold Schwarzenegger give awful performances, but it was
interesting to see them play homosexual partners; I proud.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All other performances range from substandard to merely okay. They are
not interesting, and neither is the story. The movie is too loud, extra
shallow, and offers nothing new at all. I wish they don&#x27;t make another,
because I&#x27;m gonna have to watch it as well :(&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;The stellar cast is led by the amazing &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Miles_Teller&quot;&gt;Miles Teller&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;rabbit-hole-2010&quot;&gt;Rabbit Hole&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;),
armed with a superb script. The whole exercise still left me wondering
what the point was. Feels random. I wish it was more fun, but it was
engaging enough to not leave me feeling too punished.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/13-sins-2014/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;A brilliant concept, clearly inspired by &lt;em&gt;The Game&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; thriller and &lt;em&gt;Saw&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
series of horror movies. I am a fan of Ron Perlman, so long as he&#x27;s not
given shit roles like in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;pacific-rim-2013&quot;&gt;Pacific Rim&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. He does great work here, him and
&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Rutina_Wesley&quot;&gt;Rutina Wesley&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. The &#x27;happy&#x27; ending thing is also stupid. The voice
acting of the evil guy on the phone is wonderful, and so is his script.
What a pleasure!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Story concepts this good seldom have great conclusions, and this one is
no exception. The twist is just not needed at all (it&#x27;s too much of a
stretch, both the father and brother thing). It would have also been
nice to have more of a reveal of the villains.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <pubDate>Sun, 14 Sep 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
                <link>http://tshepang.net/godzilla-2014/</link>
                <guid>http://tshepang.net/godzilla-2014/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;I found this so unpleasant that it made me miss the 1998 movie. None of
the creature designs were any good. This includes the title character,
who, in an effort to resemble the original Godzilla (1960s) ended up
clumsy as fuck. You don&#x27;t emulate shit costume design just to pay
homage, unless you are making satire maybe, or you are a plain better
director. It was also laughable having this Godzilla character be a
friend to humans (stupid twist) and having it spit fire.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The human characters (and the performances) were also not interesting.
Not one of them were convincing, and some were even unbearable at times
(check the guy playing the heroic son, or the Japanese scientist).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie is noisy and the story not interesting. The all-too-common
Hollywood thing about family values was hard to bear. So cheesy, so
stale. Sigh!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <pubDate>Sat, 16 Aug 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
                <link>http://tshepang.net/se7en-1995/</link>
                <guid>http://tshepang.net/se7en-1995/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;It would be dishonest of me to claim that my recent experience of this
movie was that of a masterpiece, a label I&#x27;ve placed on it for years.
It felt more as an academic exercise, the kind that movie students would
be &#x27;forced&#x27; to consume, in order to make notes on various elements
(and there are many notable ones).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One minor gripe I&#x27;ve had with the movie is that it lacks superb
&lt;strong&gt;acting&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. Morgan Freeman is as boring as usual with a standard
performance which isn&#x27;t really better than that of Brad Pitt. Kevin
Spacey, although much better than the two, doesn&#x27;t go anywhere near
what he&#x27;s capable of. As for others, it mainly is nothing outstanding,
but Gwyneth Paltrow is without any noticeable flaw, and is sweeter here
than anywhere else in her career.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One other gripe I&#x27;ve not been satisfied with for a while is the lack of
justification of the Envy crime. I also found the scenes with Brad
Pitt&#x27;s beloved wife forced into the story (and boring too), and a cheap
manipulation used only to serve the ending. I also never liked the chase
scene, not due its execution (David Fincher is the best movie director
who ever lived, duh!), but because the movie isn&#x27;t escapist material,
and the chase scene simply doesn&#x27;t suit it, a fact made worse by its
being too long. One other complaint is that the conversations seem mere
quick pepperings over some important philosophical issues. I do
understand that time is limited, but every time I watch the
all-important scene with John Doe sitting behind in a police car, I wish
the conversation would be longer. It was way too interesting to be kept
that short. Sure it&#x27;s handled very well (excellent editing, and
camerawork), but the cops should really have been more curious,
especially Somerset.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And given all that negativity, it doesn&#x27;t mean all&#x27;s lost. The movie
remains &lt;strong&gt;the best detective movie&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; I&#x27;ve seen yet. The cinematography
isn&#x27;t bad, but the production design is really top-class. The attention
to detail is lovely, but I&#x27;ve seen better.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rich and well-crafted as it is, the movie has a rather shallow and small
world. Nothing else exists. That could be seen as a strength of course,
for I suppose a great movie is one that can really absorb you, allowing
you to drown in its &#x27;reality&#x27;. Perhaps I was just hungry for a far
richer and complex world offered by a number of superb movies I have
been drowning in the last fews years.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following are among my favorite moments:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An early scene where an uninterested detective questions the
investigative approach of Somerset (Morgan Freeman) regarding the
first murder, where there&#x27;s blood splattered on the dirty window.
The memory of this moment, complete with its sombre atmosphere,
incites the sort of excitement that is only reserved for when I&#x27;m
in love, romantic or otherwise.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A later scene where Mills (Brad Pitt) is withstanding heavy rain
near a murder scene while waiting for the detective Somerset. The
atmosphere here helps too, as is the seeming dedication of the
officer to the job. Thinking further, I find it a stupid deed, given
there are buildings around.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The moment where the detectives are called in by a uniformed officer
into a noisy club, guiding them to a murdered prostitute. The
alarmed look of this police officer adds to the intensity of the
horrific levels of the ordeal the prostitute had to endure. I just
wonder why the club wasn&#x27;t shut down... why do these police
continue working in this noise.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;It was lots more impressive on first viewing. This time around, I found
the face animation terrible, the story recycled, complete with tired
humor, and a forced villain (why couldn&#x27;t it be trained as well, and
what&#x27;s the story... why is it so big). Luckily the whole thing is not
boring, and there are lots of scary moments and edge-of-seat action. The
concept of befriending dragons is also interesting.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <title>Appleseed Alpha (2014)</title>
                <pubDate>Fri, 18 Jul 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
                <link>http://tshepang.net/appleseed-alpha-2014/</link>
                <guid>http://tshepang.net/appleseed-alpha-2014/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;More a showcase of animation technology than a satisfying story for a
feature-length movie, it&#x27;s a prequel to the &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;appleseed-2004&quot;&gt;two&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;appleseed-ex-machina-2007&quot;&gt;movies&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. It&#x27;s got
some good things going for it:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The lips of the little girl are amazing&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The environments have wonderful detail&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The cyborg lover of the lead character of the previous movies,
Briario, is a lot more pleasing to watch&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time around, there is no noticeable 2D&#x2F;3D fusion, which helped made
me notice how sucky we still at at doing convincing human faces, unless
you have a massive budget I suppose. The movie doesn&#x27;t represent any
noticeable advancement of animation capabilities, even though it has its
moments. As regards the story, it&#x27;s interesting enough, but really has
nothing new. The giant robot thing is just stupid, and the leading lady,
who is not as a major a character as she was in the first movie, still
has unexplained physical prowess. She also too damn lucky, brushing off
highly dangerous situations like they are nothing. Sad.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/captain-america-the-winter-soldier-2014/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Far superior to &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;captain-america-the-first-avenger-2011&quot;&gt;the disgusting original&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, this one is even better than
&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-avengers-2012&quot;&gt;The Avengers&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, even without Hulk and Iron Man. The action sequences are
intense, though excessive (think &lt;em&gt;The Transformers&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;), but not too
frantic. My favorite action sequence is the Fury chase. The abilities of
the Winter Soldier matched that of Captain America, making him fun to
watch. I would have done without the flying guy (Falcon), who happens to
be overly skillful, like he was some super-human, which he&#x27;s not. Same
applies to the Black Widow character. The story is okay but does not
rise above the feeling that it attempts nothing other than keep the
franchise going. There&#x27;s lots of shortcuts, and not much depth.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <title>Noah (2014)</title>
                <pubDate>Sun, 13 Jul 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
                <link>http://tshepang.net/noah-2014/</link>
                <guid>http://tshepang.net/noah-2014/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;I think there isn&#x27;t much to the Noah story, so the writers added a few
things, like talking rocks, a magical grandfather (and pregnancy), a
pointless king (at least in the latter part of the movie), and a God
that sucks at communication. If I was tasked with creating a basic
story-line, I would have had the Noah family actually go find those
animals themselves instead of them magically be brought onto the ship.
In addition, I wouldn&#x27;t do the lazy thing where they are all put to
sleep.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was surprised (and disappointed) that the movie was directed by the
great Darren Aronofsky, who gave up &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;pi-1997&quot;&gt;Pi&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;requiem-for-a-dream-2000&quot;&gt;Requiem For A Dream&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.
There is nothing interesting&#x2F;provocative enough to deserve such a
skillful person. The visual design may be interesting, but not by much.
It is dark and desolate, which is typical of his movies, but it&#x27;s too
bland a story. It&#x27;s epic, yes, but it&#x27;s also based on one of the most
nonsensical of all stories in the Bible.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/x-men-days-of-future-past-2014/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;My favorite character is the super-fast mutant, and my favorite scene is
one where it stops security guards from killing his accomplices. The
humor is good and his abilities impressive. The time travel part wasn&#x27;t
done bad and Wolverine is interesting. The Sentinels are fearsome and
the power of Magneto ridiculous, much like he had in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;x-men-3-the-last-stand-2006&quot;&gt;X-Men 3: The Last
Stand&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see this received better reviews than any of the movies in the
franchise, but I think the &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;x-men-2-2003&quot;&gt;X-Men 2&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; was better.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <pubDate>Sun, 06 Jul 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
                <link>http://tshepang.net/cloudy-with-a-chance-of-meatballs-2009/</link>
                <guid>http://tshepang.net/cloudy-with-a-chance-of-meatballs-2009/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;It starts off amazingly well, with the same level of movie magic offered
by gems like &lt;em&gt;The Incredibles&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;megamind-2010&quot;&gt;Megamind&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, but is funnier by far.
Sadly, halfway through, things start being not so okay. That&#x27;s when we
get the ever-uninteresting, slow-the-movie-down morality talk, which
includes the beloved hero getting a little too cocky. There&#x27;s also some
annoying moments where the town inhabitants treat this hero unfairly,
like the moment where they attempt to attack him when something goes
wrong with his food-making machine. It&#x27;s fine when they are shallow and
stupid, but it gets unbearable when the writers makes them so
&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;unforgiving-characters-are-annoying&quot;&gt;unappreciative&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. One other not-too-kool thing is when these writers
push the boundaries of fantasy way too far when the food surrounding the
machine gain awareness, attacking the heroes to trying to shut the
machine down. That was just needless; the movie was already more than
good enough. Also, the mayor was just too annoying, given some villainy
that&#x27;s left unexplained.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, back to the good stuff:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The character design is amazing and so is the animation.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I enjoyed the character of the police officer, and the love he
showed for his son was touching.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The lead character is recycled, but still exciting enough.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The concept is great, and exploited well enough, even though it runs
out of steam about halfway through.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The food design is great. It reminds me of &lt;em&gt;Ratatouille&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, and even
rivals it. The most amazing of them all is the ice cream.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The jelly castle was a setting for the most enchanting moment,
making me wish fantasy was real.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

                <title>300: Rise of an Empire (2014)</title>
                <pubDate>Mon, 09 Jun 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
                <link>http://tshepang.net/300-rise-of-an-empire-2014/</link>
                <guid>http://tshepang.net/300-rise-of-an-empire-2014/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;The acting style of Eva Green worked far better in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;dark-shadows-2012&quot;&gt;Dark Shadows&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and
is in fact is embarrassing here. She is as unconvincing as the other
tough gal character, the wife of Leonidas, who had to go as being on the
front-line in battle. It&#x27;s as if someone was desperate to do the girl
power thing, to disastrous effect. Did I say embarrassing?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I like the parallel story-line approach, where much of the
events in the movies take place at the same time as those from the
earlier, and far superior, movie. Sadly we do not have an appealing
lead, and in fact not a single character impresses. The battles still
look good, but nowhere near those from the original, nor are the visuals
as amazing. The sex scene was even more stupid than the one in the
original.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/robocop-2014/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;The new suit is a lot more interesting (think the 2008 &lt;em&gt;Iron Man&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;), and
greater detail given to the workings of the man-machine combo. There is
good quality visual affects, and the movie was fun enough to have me
wish for a longer running length. I wish better actors were chosen for
the roles of wife and partner, and it would have been nice had this
partner been given a meatier role. Better still, it should have been a
woman, in honor of the 1987 movie. Or better still, get rid of the
partner. There&#x27;s enough other things to keeping things interesting. I
also wish someone else was chosen in place of the uninteresting Gary
Oldman, the same person who made the Nolan Batman trilogy less bearable
than it needed to be.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crime-fighting part was rather rushed, and the story not very solid.
I enjoyed watching Samuel L. Jackson play a commentator, and the first
scene was really good, though it felt like more was left to be said.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, this is a great reboot. I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s better than the
original for it&#x27;s been too long, but I think it&#x27;s less scary, but also
less cartoonish. The lead actor is also not as interesting. Younger yes,
but a lesser actor, and a boring face actually.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I feel like this is even worse than the 2002 movie, which I considered
the least interesting in the previous series of 3 movies. It was highly
disappointing because I heavily anticipated it (I&#x27;m a sucker for
super-hero movies). It is poorly written, and got cheesy romance and (I
wish Gwen died a lot earlier in the movie). It also has uninteresting
villains (Paul Giamatti is miscast, and so is Jamie Foxx). Not even the
visual effects impress, being worse than those of its predecessor &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-amazing-spider-man-2012&quot;&gt;the
2012 movie&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and the action is too frantic. I do like, however, the
relaxed manner to this Spider-Man. However, his skills are ridiculously
high, and he survives way too much current flowing through his body.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/kung-fu-hustle-2004/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the most entertaining I have seen yet, I couldn&#x27;t get enough of
it since I&#x27;ve done numerous repeats of my favorite scenes. It&#x27;s a
showcase of tremendous (albeit underutilized) talent, but there&#x27;s also
many scenes and characters which should have been excluded. Anyways,
much of what one sees in here is simply stuff of dreams. Example: we
have a man catching a speeding bullet with great ease, a very
unsuspecting man at that, and dressed in pyjamas and the cheapest of
sandals, and a man who soon meets his match... I don&#x27;t know if gets
more exciting than that.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, the movie is very uneven (there are both very badly-made and very
well-made parts), and looks like it suppers from a low budget. The good
parts:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The grand entrance of the world&#x27;s top killer, complete with the
bullet moment, the opening of the wall, and the conversation he
enjoys before starting a fight the couple. His is the most
interesting performance (and character) in the whole movie.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The moments involving the musical killers. The concept is brilliant
and very fresh, and the characters are very interesting, especially
the blind one.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I loved the performance of the guy playing the elastic master. He
was not the sort you&#x27;d take seriously (ever so drunk, and grinning
like he was abnormal), but that perception would quickly change when
he was forced to get violent.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Of the three warriors in the poor part of town, Pig Sty Alley, I
loved the food maker and the dressmaker. Of these, the dressmaker
was the most interesting, while also giving the best performance.
Looks out for the brief moment when they spar together before
parting. Beautiful. You will wish there was more of a backstory to
these characters.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;The deception by the aliens on humans is one of the interesting things
about the movie, and the other being the flirting between the Pierce
Brosnan and the Sarah Jessica Parker characters. The latter is actually
quite charming, especially as a dog. Other interesting characters are
the forgetful lady and the disguised alien.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie is overall entertaining, but has just too much violence...
the attacks are prolonged. The sub-plot about the former boxer is
horrible, complete with bad acting and uninteresting characters (boxer,
wife, kids) and looks like it&#x27;s from some shitty B-movie. The whole
thing is also pointless.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;A bizarre and sleep-inducing work, this dark comedy has its moments:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The scene with Billy Bon Thornton is fun to watch, due to the
idiotic behavior of his character and its companions. It is my
favorite in the movie.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The character of the native American feels more of a guardian angel
than anything real. One feels a sense of comfort having him around,
and his bravery commendable, not to mention his kindness. He is the
most unusual character of them all, or should I say the most
unconvincing.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The character of Crispin Glover is also bizarre. He gives a very
good performance, brief as it is.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#x27;t know what the fuck&#x27;s up with the story though, what the point
of it all is. Why do people make movies like this? It does however
possess the honor of having an entire book written about it, by &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;best-movie-critic-jonathan-rosenbaum&quot;&gt;the
great Jonathan Rosenbaum&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Not such a great year at the movies, even worse than &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;2012-movie-review&quot;&gt;last year&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, though
I think I also watched a lot less movies. Luckily there&#x27;s two excellent
ones, the best being &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;in-bruges-2008&quot;&gt;In Bruges&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. It also boasts the year&#x27;s best
&lt;strong&gt;direction&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;cinematography&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;script&#x2F;dialog&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. The other
excellent movie is &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;redbelt-2007&quot;&gt;Redbelt&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;visuals&quot;&gt;visuals&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;cleanskin-2012&quot;&gt;Cleanskin&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; has the best &lt;strong&gt;action&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;, while &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;man-of-steel-2013&quot;&gt;Man of Steel&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; has the best
&lt;strong&gt;action sequence&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;, the first battle with second-in-command of Zod. The
movie also has the best &lt;strong&gt;visual effects&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;, followed by &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;elysium-2013&quot;&gt;Elysium&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;performances&quot;&gt;performances&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My &lt;strong&gt;favorite performance&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is that of Tom Towles playing Otis in
&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;henry-portrait-of-a-serial-killer&quot;&gt;Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Runner-up is the hypnotized lady
in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;now-you-see-me-2013&quot;&gt;Now You See Me&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, followed by &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Michael_Parks&quot;&gt;Michael Parks&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;django-unchained-2012&quot;&gt;Django Unchained&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.
The &lt;strong&gt;best male performance&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is by &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Chiwetel_Ejiofor&quot;&gt;Chiwetel Ejiofor&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; as an instructor
in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;redbelt-2007&quot;&gt;Redbelt&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, while the &lt;strong&gt;best female performance&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is by Charlotte
Rampling in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;cleanskin-2012&quot;&gt;Cleanskin&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;characters&quot;&gt;characters&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My &lt;strong&gt;favorite character&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is the honorable martial arts instructor in
&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;redbelt-2007&quot;&gt;Redbelt&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, played by Chiwetel Ejiofor. The most &lt;strong&gt;desirable gal&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is the
love interest in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;in-bruges-2008&quot;&gt;In Bruges&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best &lt;strong&gt;character design&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is the fearsome The Missionary in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;silent-hill-revelation-2012&quot;&gt;Silent
Hill: Revelation&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, followed by the bizarre floating giants in
&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;mirrormask-2005&quot;&gt;MirrorMask&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;miscellaneous&quot;&gt;miscellaneous&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most &lt;strong&gt;important&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; movie is &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-thaw-2009&quot;&gt;The Thaw&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; due to its well-delivered
story, which is related to the consequences of global warming. Runner-up
is &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;seven-psychopaths-2012&quot;&gt;Seven Psychopaths&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; due to its stance on homophobia and interracial
relationships. There is a tie for the most &lt;strong&gt;bizarre&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; movie: &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;cloud-atlas-2012&quot;&gt;Cloud
Atlas&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;mirrormask-2005&quot;&gt;MirrorMask&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most &lt;strong&gt;innovative&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; movie is the satirical &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;goodbye-uncle-tom-1971&quot;&gt;Goodbye Uncle Tom&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;:
it&#x27;s shot like a documentary in which the makers travel to a
particularly horrid moment in United States history, yet treating it
with humor... very daring.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The title for &lt;strong&gt;best &#x27;old&#x27; movie experience&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; goes to &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;payback-1999&quot;&gt;Payback&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. This
a title for a movie I&#x27;ve seen before this year. A special mention
should go to the &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;payback-straight-up-2006&quot;&gt;Director&#x27;s Cut version&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, which I saw first time in
2013.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <title>Django Unchained (2012)</title>
                <pubDate>Sun, 25 May 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
                <link>http://tshepang.net/django-unchained-2012/</link>
                <guid>http://tshepang.net/django-unchained-2012/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Lots of humor, brutality (the suffering of the slaves is just too
intense), violence, and heroism. The movie has the rare quality of being
entertaining throughout, a feat more impressive given the movie&#x27;s
running length of over 150 minutes. Tarantino also decided to go a bit
lazy on us (as he did with the &lt;em&gt;Kill Bill&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; movies) by sprinkling fantasy
over his script, where for example we find the heroic Django
highly-skilled with a gun, without a lot of training. Another example is
the number of men the DiCaprio character has at his command, an excuse
to spill liters of blood, as well as showcase the Django excellence. If
only the lead was a better (or more interesting) actor than Jamie Foxx.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite (and best) scene is one where the great Tarantino appears. I
find it the best directed of all, even though there are more showy and
complex ones. My favorite performance there is the oldest of the white
guys, played by &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Michael_Parks&quot;&gt;Michael Parks&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. I also enjoyed watching the guys in the
cage, not to mention Tarantino himself (good actor this guy). As a
sidenote, it seems he was not comfortable sayig the word &lt;em&gt;nigga&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;,
resorting to &lt;em&gt;blackie&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Although directing&#x2F;editing style is not new, it still feels fresh. The
visual effects are also done well, but the aftermath of the damage done
by both the title characters and the military is done even better. One
thing that&#x27;s impressive about the whole production is that it&#x27;s very
expansive for a budget of less than $1 million. You would not even
notice. Sadly, there is a point where the lead characters are tiring,
such that I&#x27;d appreciate if at least one of them got killed at some
point. They are also too damn lucky.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I don&#x27;t know how many times I saw this one as a kid, but I loved it
a-lot. I even went as far as proclaiming it to have the best martial
arts choreography of all movies. After this revisit, however, I am not
so sure anymore. I don&#x27;t have a replacement in mind though. It remains
impressive of course, but feels dated. The shallowness of the story
doesn&#x27;t help either... some important issues (racism, prostitution,
xenophobia) are highlighted, but it doesn&#x27;t look like the writers were
good enough to exploit them. They were pretty much glossed over, and the
romance was very unconvincing.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <title>The Triplets of Belleville (2003)</title>
                <pubDate>Mon, 19 May 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
                <link>http://tshepang.net/the-triplets-of-belleville-2003/</link>
                <guid>http://tshepang.net/the-triplets-of-belleville-2003/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Here&#x27;s what I wrote some years ago:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Totally unlike anything I&#x27;ve seen before, an extraordinary animated
feature, with some superb music, magnificent characters, and amazing
stylistic choices, and supreme storytelling... It&#x27;s an awesome
experience, pity it runs for less than 80 minutes. It carries greater
emotional impact than most movies I&#x27;ve seen.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here&#x27;s what I wrote in 2010:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That still stands except the last sentence, since the revisit brought
no such impact. Let me add that the movie is a bizarre ride (no
dialog, unseemly super-tough heroes, etc.) and that the highlight of
the wonderful music is the one track at start of the end-credits. I
also remember enjoying the raunchy opening sequence much more than on
this revisit.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a third viewing, it feels more a curious experiment than a serious
movie, and it remains as unusual as ever. I love the mother (her resolve
is impressive), but the title characters are even more interesting. The
dog, dumb as it is, is lovable. There is not much going on in the movie,
and if fact, what is supposed to be a climax is just a string of
fantasy-like quirky moments. By the way, I should have said &lt;em&gt;practically
no dialog&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. There is a bit, but no more than two or three sentences.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <pubDate>Sun, 18 May 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
                <link>http://tshepang.net/the-human-centipede-2-2011/</link>
                <guid>http://tshepang.net/the-human-centipede-2-2011/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;I do not remember watching a more extreme movie, in terms of
(hard-to-watch) gore. The director also tried real hard to make the lead
character as repulsive as possible, a character lucky enough to get a
wonderful performance by &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.imdb.com&#x2F;name&#x2F;nm4030776&quot;&gt;Laurence R. Harvey&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (his first movie).
Interestingly, this character cannot be blamed for the harms he inflicts
on others, given he&#x27;s mentally disturbed, complete with a rather
unhappy toddler-hood. It&#x27;s a pity three of the other characters were
just lazily-developed, making them unconvincing:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mommy was a cheap copy of the one in &lt;em&gt;Precious&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. The story went too
far by having her try to kill her own child, though the reaction of
this child, the lead character, was super-kool... so damn oblivious
to what just occurred. Did I mention I love this character?&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The horny guy with a large beard should have been given more of a
story. He is interesting, but his actions were just left
unexplained... his sexual attraction to the lead character. It was
also real stupid placing him near the workplace of this lead
character.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The loud neighbor was too much of an ass-hole, going as far as
assaulting the lead character for practically no reason. That was
just stupid.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I though it was quite daring to include the pregnant woman among the
victims. Worse still, her giving birth like that. Wow! Talk of pushing
boundaries. Also, the movie may not be as fresh as its predecessor, but
it&#x27;s a lot better (direction, cinematography, acting).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Very nice production and creature design, although both these elements
have been copied (inspired) from elsewhere. The whole thing is rather
disturbing though (&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ben_Foster&quot;&gt;Ben Foster&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is an intense actor; the sound effects
were extremely loud; the sounds made by the creatures didn&#x27;t help
either). It&#x27;s edge-of-your-seat stuff, with horrid enemies all over.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Real nice camerawork and direction; very interesting performances. The
brutal acts of the criminal are sadly left unjustified&#x2F;unexplained.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still feel the same, surprisingly, but I neglected to mention my
favorites: the driver, the court snitch, the private investigator (the
ever-excellent William H. Macy), and the desirable female detective.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I find it daring to have Denzel Washington play a character this broken.
Not evil, just broken. I don&#x27;t know what was the point of drug addict
lover; maybe it was added in order to have the viewers sympathize with
this Washington character (he cared for her even though she was also
broken), but his saving of lives already put him in our favor. No, she
wasn&#x27;t needed, at all, but she was welcome.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High quality direction, performances, and dialog; an unusual and rather
unpredictable story; an unneeded, but colorful, character (John
Goodman); an exciting airplane incident; a very fitting ending.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;A well-made and unusual sci-fi about some humanoid super-beings that run
the world. They remain unexplained, and they attempt to get the Matt
Damon character (good job) to be American president. Part of achieving
that is getting him away from his favorite gal, and although they give
something of a flimsy excuse, it makes the plot interesting. That&#x27;s
despite that fact that the romance is overdone.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <pubDate>Sun, 04 May 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
                <link>http://tshepang.net/pathology-2008/</link>
                <guid>http://tshepang.net/pathology-2008/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;good&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite an original story with a spectacular opening sequence, and a touch
here and there of wonderful shots (e.g. check the part where the lead
drinks water greedily, the day after his first experience).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is wonderful casting too, even though I&#x27;ll have to excuse the
lead and the villain. I most especially appreciate the role of the
middle-aged lead of the team, played by &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;John_de_Lancie&quot;&gt;John de Lancie&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. He was a
pleasure to watch. There was also another nice, but tiny, performance by
the guy playing the fiance&#x27;s father. There&#x27;s great characters, like
the massive black guy, as well as the trailer-trash fat guy. The dialog
is quite good too, and the make-up is even better.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;bad&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story is quite silly, and rather pointless. The lead transforms
(participates in the game) way too quick to convince. There is also too
much (raunchy) sex, most of which is needless. The great jealousy the
villains portray is unconvincing, and so is their bullying. Also, the
ending feels rushed, as if there wasn&#x27;t much material to work with.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed reading &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;variety.com&#x2F;2008&#x2F;film&#x2F;reviews&#x2F;pathology-1200535058&quot;&gt;this review&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of wonderful editing and gorgeous shots, most especially
in the beginning... the first 20 minutes, just before the pre-historic,
beginning of life section. My favorite of these shots is the waterfall.
It&#x27;s amazing. Also, in those 20 minutes, I enjoyed the Sean Penn
moments the most... I don&#x27;t remember corporate environments shot (and
edited) that way.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is not much else to celebrate, unfortunately: Brad Pitt is miscast
(i.e. unconvincing), the movie is mostly boring and unbearably
meditative, and much of mutterings (prayers and thoughts) of the
characters unintelligible, like I&#x27;m supposed to fill in the blanks. I
also don&#x27;t know what the point of the entire exercise is, though I
liked the fact that the strict father wasn&#x27;t presented in a shallow
manner... he had sweet moments, and even apologized for his shitty
behavior.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Of all the (multiple) conversations the lead character has, my most
favorite is the one with the lady with red hair. This lead, largely a
passive listener, engages a more than usual, while also introspecting
self the most. One other scene I enjoyed is that involving a group of
four friends, who do a lot of negative talk, which is so deliberate it
feels rehearsed. Most of the conversations are nonsensical, which can be
challenging to my patience. It&#x27;s an interesting, and strange movie.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <title>Boogie Nights (1997)</title>

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I watched this several years ago and do not remember being impressed. I
just now revisited it to ensure I didn&#x27;t miss anything. Well, it&#x27;s not
much. The character of the lead is curious, with its great innocence and
kindness, until over halfway through the movie when he displays
jealousy. It&#x27;s not a good performance, but more a half-comic one. The
more interesting one is that by Julianne Moore, who is more desirable
here than elsewhere (if memory serves well).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The violence feels forced. Also, some extended sequences, e.g. the
shitty fire-cracker scene, help make the movie overly long, at over 150
minutes. The whole exercise feels pointless, and &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Boogie_Nights#Release_and_reception&quot;&gt;is way overrated&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Hugh Jackman gives his best performance I&#x27;ve seen, and none of the
others are lacking. The movie is also very well-made, and I could smell
the skill (and freshness) in the opening scenes, just before the girls
disappear. The rest of it remains interesting, despite the running
length of over 140 minutes. I would have preferred something shorter,
especially since the ending bits are not quite as impressive. The twist
was also a big let-down, with the (newly-revealed) villain unconvincing.
Also, some key plot points were left unexplained, or maybe I just missed
them. One example: why did the suspects keep quiet?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;This somewhat experimental work chronicles the suffering and thoughts of
an intellectual giant during an intense cancer treatment that lasts
several months. The performance of Emma Thompson is incredible, and the
best she ever gave. There is not a lot going on, but there isn&#x27;t a
boring moment. Beyond the lead character, others are
highly-well-development, most especially the lead, the young doctor, and
the nurse in charge... what an angel.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie is important in highlighting the cold treatment one could
experience in health care facilities. This happens most in the early
moments of the movie, and even feels exaggerated, especially given the
prestige of the clinic.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/red-2-2013/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;A lot more enjoyable than &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;red-2010&quot;&gt;its predecessor&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, it has one amazing
performance by Anthony Hopkins in a rather fitting role. Luckily his
talent wasn&#x27;t wasted here as was the case in the two super-hero movies,
&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;thor-2011&quot;&gt;Thor&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;thor-the-dark-world-2013&quot;&gt;Thor: The Dark World&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. I also enjoyed watching the Asian guy
(he looks lethal), as well as the romantic antics of the female assassin
(Helen Mirren) and his Russian lover.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plot of the movie is complicated and some of the humor works (see
the Helen Mirren paying with her feet while unleashing her violence).
But the movie is too much of a fantasy, and is way too loud. Some of it
was good though, and my favorite was the first, in which the hero
escapes from some especially unfeeling government agent.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;A very rough twist&#x2F;revelation happens near the end, and that alone makes
the whole movie worthy. It&#x27;s also well-made, well-written, and got
decent acting, my favorite being the lady that plays the twin daughter.
It is also one of those rare movies that let a tear escape from my
eyes... the bus deception incident.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie took things a little far by having this mother be an assassin.
Also, her old age make-up could be better.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <title>Cloverfield (2008)</title>
                <pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
                <link>http://tshepang.net/cloverfield-2008/</link>
                <guid>http://tshepang.net/cloverfield-2008/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;cloverfield-vs-i-am-legend&quot;&gt;I once compared this movie with I Am Legend&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and I then I had the
following to say later that year:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A revisit of &lt;em&gt;Cloverfield&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; wasn&#x27;t as much a let-down as that of &lt;em&gt;I Am
Legend&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and am even tempted that it&#x27;s so far the year&#x27;s greatest
achievement in visual effects. I just want more of that fabulous
monster, and hopefully in a really good sequel. Perhaps an equally
good sequel would be another discovered tape, maybe with a bigger
budget. Here&#x27;s me salivating on what could be an extremely satisfying
franchise. I just so much wish no one will fuck up the idea.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the above are still accurate, except I didn&#x27;t enjoy the plot as
much this (third) time around. The setup was okay, all but the romance
part of it, which just felt tired. I also found it far-fetched to have
the guy brave the monsters to go rescue gal, and managing to drag around
two more people on his quest onto a heavily-compromised building, up
dozens of stairs, all to find a gal heavily injured, yet managing to run
around for several minutes on end... makes me sad :(&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/captain-phillips-2013/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;I hardly ever enjoy Tom Hanks performances, but this one was very
watchable, though his best moments are only at the very end, after his
rescue. I also enjoyed watching the lead of the pirates, which is a
rather unusual casting choice. He is also the most interesting character
in the movie, a villain that provides comfort for his victim, and &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;caring-about-villains&quot;&gt;a
villain we get to care for&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One other special thing about the movie is the subject matter, which I
don&#x27;t remember ever seeing explored before in movies: modern-day ship
piracy. Another special thing is the attention to detail regarding the
cargo ship, which is also a rare sight. The direction is of decent
quality and so is the tension.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie could be shorter though, and the numerous attempts by the
title character to prevail are tiring. The movie also moves too quick
from Somalia to the seas... there is not enough exploration of the
background of our villains.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/doubt-2008/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Possessing some of the best works of cinematography and production
design ever, the movie also boasts some of the most intense dialogues
I&#x27;ve seen yet, and an amazing performance from Philip Seymour Hoffman
as a Catholic priest. His enemy is one of the most relentless characters
in movie history, played by a miscast Meryl Streep. Her lack of fear for
confrontation and her quick-to-act attitude are admirable, but her
brutality is rather unreasonable.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/the-counselor-2013/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;The direction is very unusual, the performances are of high quality
(Brad Pitt is amazing, and so is Penélope Cruz, not to mention the guy
that played Hitler in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;downfall-2004&quot;&gt;Downfall&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;), and the story gets more edgy as it
progresses. I need to see it again to understand it better... it&#x27;s
complex, and much of what&#x27;s going on is only implied.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;There is &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;skymovies.sky.com&#x2F;excision&#x2F;revie&quot;&gt;a good review&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; about this, a movie that starts with more
promise than it delivers. The imagery is provocative, but not really
shocking. The movie done and written quite well, complete with quality
performances, my favorite of which is that of the lead. She&#x27;s also damn
beautiful, though nearly as much as the gal across the street... wow!
The ending is a let-down... too unrealistic.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I liked this bit in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fearnet.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;review&#x2F;sundance-2012-excision-review&quot;&gt;another quality review&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, which will become relevant
one you are done watching:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...she&#x27;s quickly blossoming into quite the amateur surgeon.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;The lady playing wife gives an amazing performance, most visible in the
moments of mental torment and physical exhaustion. She&#x27;s also so damn
pretty, her and the rest of her family. Another good performance is the
almost comic one by the lead perpetrator, whose few moments of talking
with the audience (us) represent a rather daring directorial choice,
given the seriousness of the situation. It&#x27;s also a very welcome
choice. The direction is excellent: see how the aftermath of a great
loss is done, and see how touching the love between husband and wife is.
The pacing is slow at times without being boring for a moment.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Mireille Enos, who plays the wife, gives a really nice performance. Sean
Penn, on the other hand, gives the worst of his career, perhaps due to
the shitty make-up and bad character development. The movie starts off
well, with the superbly-made heroic antics of the Josh Brolin character,
complete with excellent cinematography and production design. But soon
after, it feels like a failed attempt at an &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;l-a-confidential-1997&quot;&gt;L.A. Confidential&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and got
unfunny humor and misguided romance.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I was very surprised when I went through a list of movies I tagged as
excellent, which I watched first time in 2011, and found several. One
problem though is that I can&#x27;t rank them because I don&#x27;t fully
remember the experiences of all. Luckily, I know which of the movies are
at the top:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;megamind-2010&quot;&gt;Megamind&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ranking of those taking second spot may very well be careless
because I only watched them once, but the impact they had on me is still
vivid, so they stay, at least for now.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#x27;s the rest (ranked alphabetically):&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;downfall-2004&quot;&gt;Downfall&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the year&#x27;s &lt;strong&gt;best production design&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;, there is a tie between

&lt;li&gt;trash in the recycling plant (&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;toy-story-3-2010&quot;&gt;Toy Story 3&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;) +++ maybe a cheat since
this is animation, but I needed to mention it&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The year&#x27;s &lt;strong&gt;best animation&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is a tie between &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;rango-2011&quot;&gt;Rango&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;legend-of-the-guardians-the-owls-of-gahoole-2010&quot;&gt;Legend of
the Guardians&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Both offer lengthy moments of hyper-realistic imagery.
The runner-up is &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;9-2009&quot;&gt;9&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; with it&#x27;s wonderful action sequences.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the &lt;strong&gt;best action&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is offered by &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;9-2009&quot;&gt;9&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, the &lt;strong&gt;best action
sequence&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is the &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Powered_exoskeleton&quot;&gt;exoskeleton&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; chase in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;gi-joe-the-rise-of-cobra-2009&quot;&gt;G.I. Joe: The
Rise of Cobra&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. However, there &lt;strong&gt;most innovative sequence&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is the
split-screen bounty hunter scene found in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-green-hornet-2011&quot;&gt;The Green Hornet&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;performances&quot;&gt;performances&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My &lt;strong&gt;favorite performance&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is that of &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Andie_MacDowell&quot;&gt;Andie MacDowell&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; when playing
the sweet love interest in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;sex-lies-and-videotape-1989&quot;&gt;Sex, Lies, and Videotape&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. First runner-up
is a tie between Vera Farmica as sad mother (&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;orphan-2009&quot;&gt;Orphan&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;) and &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;John_de_Lancie&quot;&gt;Jon de
Lancie&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; as lead of pathology (&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;pathology-2008&quot;&gt;Pathology&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;). 2nd runner-up is Sandra Oh
(&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;rabbit-hole-2010&quot;&gt;Rabbit Hole&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;best male performance&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is by Geoffrey Rush when playing a
therapist in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-king-s-speech-2010&quot;&gt;The Kings&#x27;s Speech&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Here&#x27;s the runner-ups:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Miles_Teller&quot;&gt;Miles Teller&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;rabbit-hole-2010&quot;&gt;Rabbit Hole&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lennie_James&quot;&gt;Lennie James&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-next-three-days-2010&quot;&gt;The Next Three Days&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Russell_Brand&quot;&gt;Russell Brand&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;get-him-to-the-greek-2010&quot;&gt;Get Him to the Greek&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;best female performance&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is by Nicole Kidman in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;rabbit-hole-2010&quot;&gt;Rabbit Hole&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
and the &lt;strong&gt;best cast&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is from the same movie. Maybe it&#x27;s a distant
second, but the runner-up on that category is &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;pathology-2008&quot;&gt;Pathology&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. The &lt;strong&gt;best
voice talent&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is that of &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;rango-2011&quot;&gt;Rango&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;characters&quot;&gt;characters&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As regards the &lt;strong&gt;best character development&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;, James Spader&#x27;s
free-spirited character in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;sex-lies-and-videotape-1989&quot;&gt;Sex, Lies, and Videotape&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; ties with Nicole
Kidman&#x27;s grieving asshole in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;rabbit-hole-2010&quot;&gt;Rabbit Hole&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Runner-up is the evil
peacock in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;kung-fu-panda-2-2011&quot;&gt;Kung Fu Panda 2&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, the same peacock that happens to be the
year&#x27;s &lt;strong&gt;best villain&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. Despite his cruelty, his oft-humorous demeanor
made me care about him, which is the sort of quality I find exceptional
in terms of character development of villains.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;best character design&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is that of the main villain in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;9-2009&quot;&gt;9&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
followed by the ninjas in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-warriors-way-2010&quot;&gt;The Warrior&#x27;s Way&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The year&#x27;s &lt;strong&gt;most desirable gal&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Sandra_Oh&quot;&gt;Sandra Oh&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;rabbit-hole-2010&quot;&gt;Rabbit Hole&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
playing a small role as the love interest. Watching this has changed my
view of her... I want her, now! Here&#x27;s the runner-ups:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Andie_MacDowell&quot;&gt;Andie MacDowell&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;sex-lies-and-videotape-1989&quot;&gt;Sex, Lies, and Videotape&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Teri_Hatcher&quot;&gt;Teri Hatcher&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;tango-cash-1989&quot;&gt;Tango &amp;amp; Cash&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Jill_Schoelen&quot;&gt;Jill Schoelen&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-stepfather-1987&quot;&gt;The Stepfather&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;according-to-greta-2009&quot;&gt;According to Greta&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; boasts both the &lt;strong&gt;most perfect gentleman&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; (the
lead&#x27;s boyfriend) and the &lt;strong&gt;most perfect father&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; (the lead&#x27;s
grandpa).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was impressed by Lennie James in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-next-three-days-2010&quot;&gt;The Next Three Days&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, making him the
year&#x27;s &lt;strong&gt;favorite detective&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;best comic character&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is the fat guy in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;shes-out-of-my-league-2010&quot;&gt;She&#x27;s Out of My
League&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, followed by a tie between Jack Black&#x27;s partner in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;nacho-libre-2006&quot;&gt;Nacho
Libre&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and the fat oversexed woman in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;nanny-mcphee-and-the-big-bang-2010&quot;&gt;Nanny McPhee And The Big Bang&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;miscellaneous&quot;&gt;miscellaneous&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The category of &lt;strong&gt;most important movie&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; exists in order to recognize
movies that deliver certain ideas&#x2F;messages I find extremely important;
The harmful effects of making abortion illegal are portrayed in a very
powerful way in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;4-months-3-weeks-and-2-days-2007&quot;&gt;4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and that easily makes
the movie the winner. There&#x27;s a tie between the 2 runner-ups:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;fair-game&quot;&gt;Fair Game&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (harmful suppression of truth by powerful government
officials)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each repeat of a movie is a different experience, hence this category of
&lt;strong&gt;best first-time viewing experience&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. It&#x27;s won by &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;megamind-2010&quot;&gt;Megamind&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (it blew
my mind away due to its seeming perfection) and the runner-up is &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;shrek-forever-after-2010&quot;&gt;Shrek
Forever After&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, which sadly couldn&#x27;t survive a revisit.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;worst revisit&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; was &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;shrek-forever-after-2010&quot;&gt;Shrek Forever After&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. I deemed it a
masterpiece on first viewing, but it seemed a different (and worse)
movie on a revisit. Not that it was trash. It was just not very good.
The runner-up is &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-warriors-way-2010&quot;&gt;The Warrior&#x27;s Way&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the year&#x27;s &lt;strong&gt;best script&#x2F;dialog&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;, we have &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;sex-lies-and-videotape-1989&quot;&gt;Sex, Lies, and Videotape&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The year&#x27;s &lt;strong&gt;funniest movie&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;bill-teds-bogus-journey-1991&quot;&gt;Bill &amp;amp; Ted&#x27;s Bogus Journey&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. The
first runner-up is &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;being-there-1979&quot;&gt;Being There&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, while its two 2nd runner-ups are a
tie: &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;brewsters-millions-1985&quot;&gt;Brewster&#x27;s Millions&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (surprising entrant) and &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;semi-pro-2008&quot;&gt;Semi-Pro&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The year&#x27;s &lt;strong&gt;most enchanting&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; movie is &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;megamind-2010&quot;&gt;Megamind&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, followed by
&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;tangled-2010&quot;&gt;Tangled&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The year&#x27;s &lt;strong&gt;most original story&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is that of &lt;strong&gt;The Idiots&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; (the
subject matter of conmen is fairly popular yes, but in here is the added
twist of the perpetrators not having any material gain out of it). The
runner-up is &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;dark-matter-2007&quot;&gt;Dark Matter&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, followed by &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;pathology-2008&quot;&gt;Pathology&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. The &lt;strong&gt;best story
concept&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; can be seen in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;groundhog-day-1993&quot;&gt;Groundhog Day&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, where the lead character
experiences the same day over and over again.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#x27;t really pay much attention to this one, but I&#x27;ll give the
&lt;strong&gt;best make-up&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; honor to &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;pathology-2008&quot;&gt;Pathology&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for making corpses look so
convincing.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;most overrated&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; movie is &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;sunset-boulevard-1950&quot;&gt;Sunset Boulevard&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; followed by &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;all-about-eve-1950&quot;&gt;All
About Eve&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. The former is substandard while the second is quite decent.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;old-movies&quot;&gt;&#x27;old&#x27; movies&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section is meant to give a chance to movies I have watched before
this year to appear in this review, for one reason or another.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of those, the &lt;strong&gt;best experience&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; was offered by the masterpiece,
&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;requiem-for-a-dream-2000&quot;&gt;Requiem for A Dream&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. It was almost a surprise that the intensity of
the experience was as great as was on first viewing, a very rare
quality.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#x27;s the runner-ups:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;mandingo-1975&quot;&gt;Mandingo&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; -- the best movie on US slavery I&#x27;ve seen yet&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-bourne-supremacy-2004&quot;&gt;The Bourne Supremacy&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; -- among the best action thrillers I&#x27;ve seen
yet&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;bill-teds-excellent-adventure-1989&quot;&gt;Bill &amp;amp; Ted&#x27;s Excellent Adventure&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, whose continued excellence and
humor surprised me, it being a childhood favorite, and also being
made in the 80&#x27;s, a bad movie decade.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Would be kinda nice to be caught in an eternal day. Imagine all the
stuff you can learn, and all the experiences you can have. All the risky
things you&#x27;d do, and all the impact you can have on people. That&#x27;s
what the lead character does, and he goes as far as committing suicde a
few times, only to wake up the next day, and the next day.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie is done well, but has not aged too well. Would be nice to see
a remake of one of the most interesting movie concepts ever.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/mainstream-critics-are-strange/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Following is my experiences of movies on the &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bfi.org.uk&#x2F;news&#x2F;50-greatest-films-all-time&quot;&gt;Sight &amp;amp; Sound list&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; of the
10 greatest movies ever made:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ve seen the overrated &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;citizen-kane-1941&quot;&gt;Citizen Kane&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and slept through the &lt;em&gt;2001: A
Space Odyssey&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. I did not find anything particularly exceptional about
&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;tokyo-story-1953&quot;&gt;Tokyo Story&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Searchers&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; does not deserve to be mentioned
(except maybe for the lead&#x27;s surprising non-angelic persona, which
gives him some complexity). I did not notice a single thing special
about &lt;em&gt;Vertigo&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, which made it more shocking given that the critics
regarded it the greatest movie ever made! It was even more perplexing to
find anyone honoring &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;rashomon-1950&quot;&gt;Rashomon&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; at all. Of all those I&#x27;ve seen, the
only one I actually like is &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-passion-of-joan-of-arc-1928&quot;&gt;The Passion of Joan of Arc&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Michael_Shannon_(actor)&quot;&gt;Michael Shannon&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; gives an excellent and unusual performance as a
fearsome contract killer, in a movie with excellent cinematography and
production design, and excellent writing. Another notable performance is
that of &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ray_Liotta&quot;&gt;Ray Liotta&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, even though he plays one of his usual characters,
only this time I really enjoyed him, perhaps even more than in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;smokin-aces-2006&quot;&gt;Smokin&#x27;
Aces&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. There is not one other performance that is lacking, and even
&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Chris_Evans_(actor)&quot;&gt;Chris Evans&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; helped by hiding his not-too-talented face behind a large
beard.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;We here see a world where people stop physically aging when they reach
25 and have a year to live unless they get more (or less) time. Money is
replaced by time as currency, and the reason the setup is such is left
unexplained, though the hint given is population control. It also
appears as if the situation can&#x27;t be changed.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This beautiful concept is fucked by a lazy plot and stupid casting
choices (the people were supposed to look 25). The best fun in the movie
can only be seen in the early scenes, but then the overly-courageous
acts and extra skills of the Justin Timberlake character were left
unexplained... lazy writing. Luckily it&#x27;s not boring, even to the end.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/the-butler-2013/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;The most shocking thing about this overrated bore is that it was made by
Lee Daniels, the same guy who made the most impressive movie made in
the last few years, &lt;em&gt;Precious&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; (2009). It&#x27;s fucking weird! It&#x27;s among the most
surprising things in all of my experiences watching movies. Not even a
wonderful actor like Forest Whitaker pulled off a decent performance.
He&#x27;s embarrassing even, though not as much as Oprah Winfrey, who was
supposed to be a quality actor, given her &lt;em&gt;Color Purple&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; performance
(though I haven&#x27;t seen that in over 10 years). Something must have gone
seriously wrong. Maybe it was a troubled production?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, it&#x27;s not utter trash. I liked the concept of the heroic
activists being prepared for racist taunts, which was quite fresh. Not
that it was particularly well-made, but that it&#x27;s just something I
haven&#x27;t seen before in a movie. Another highlight is the character of
the younger brother of the activist at the dinner table, specifically
the &lt;em&gt;party&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; moment. It was beautiful. Sadly, not much else was. None of
the other performances were good (and I&#x27;m not exaggerating), and the
old-age make-up was even worse. Ridiculous!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;The two kids are a lot more interesting than the parents in this dark
comedy about a troublesome family that finds itself under witness
protection. It&#x27;s well-made (and well-shot) but not very well-written.
The over-the-top violence imposed the each of the family members are
supposed to be funny, but fall flat, and I don&#x27;t like how their cruelty
is downplayed.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also feel Robert De Niro, the guy that gave &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;top-movie-performances&quot;&gt;the best performance in
history&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, should have retired over a decade ago. He hasn&#x27;t done
anything worthy of his skills, and is not interesting enough to keep me
interested. Or maybe he&#x27;s just overrated, and incapable of doing
anything beyond his usual bad guy persona. He&#x27;s boring, though the
movie isn&#x27;t.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Nice performance by Brendan Fraser as the lead, and an even better one
by &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;David_O&amp;#x27;Hara&quot;&gt;the guy playing the villain&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. The film is quite enjoyable (not a
boring moment) and the romance beautiful. I don&#x27;t remember a woman
fearing her own child as is the case with mother of gangster. Good
direction and acting there.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Lots of exciting street shots, a very interesting (and immensely
desirable) female lead, some quality performances (the villainous
detective most especially), and nice production design. The movie did
not also need the political sob story involving some child. The two
instances of rivalry were done well: that between the lead and the
co-worker, and between him and the police bicycle rider. The action is
over-the-top, and downplays the dangers these bicycle riders impose on
others, and on themselves. It could have been just as exciting had it
been more realistic I think.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;An improvement over &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;thor-2011&quot;&gt;the original&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, it has far superior visual effects
(the evil dark energy and the epic duels), a far more interesting
villain, and superior character design. Sadly, we are still stuck with
two very uninteresting characters: those played by Natalie Portman (the
stale love interest) and &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Kat_Dennings&quot;&gt;Kat Dennings&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (the unfunny comic relief).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;The are three performances that stand out:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forest Whitaker gives &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;best-of-career-performances&quot;&gt;the best one of his career&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; playing the title
character. His is also a very well-developed character.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;James McAvoy gives an excellent one as the advisor, though his
character is not very fresh... tis been done before.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kerry Washington is both a desirable and very capable actor, and
there isn&#x27;t a lack of those two qualities here.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie is very well-made, complete with quality production design and
an interesting story.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;An unusual and somewhat dull movie which has the lead tell a the story
of his alien origins, a story so ridiculous it has people think is just
made-up as part of his entertainment set as a musician. This character
is played by a guy with an interesting face, a Jet Li lookalike, making
him a pleasure to eye. The other alien that later befriends him is fun
to watch, and the female police officer is pretty as fuck.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/the-wolverine-2013/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;A lot better than &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;x-men-origins-wolverine-2009&quot;&gt;its predecessor&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, it is even more unusual in that it
doesn&#x27;t feel like part of the &lt;em&gt;X-Men&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; franchise, both in terms of story
and direction. It starts off quite well, with decent family drama where
you wonder WTF&#x27;s goin&#x27; on. It proceeds to some intense gritty action,
and some cheesy romance, and finally gets a not-so-exciting ending. It
left me wishing there were more mutants, for what we have here isn&#x27;t
very interesting (the poison lady is curious, but she isn&#x27;t very
interesting, and neither is her powers).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few of the performances are interesting, most especially the gal with
the deformed face, though she&#x27;s too much of a curiosity than an
essential character. The son of the dying man gets a commanding
performance, though the characterization is rather stale... done so
damn many times before. I am no fan of Hugh Jackman, but this one is his
best attempt at doing the title character so far. The design of the
giant samurai armor is amazing.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish the cinematography and production design felt less stagey, and
the sounds less retarded (e.g. metallic sounds emanate from swords
cutting through human flesh).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I kept waiting for an explanation of why the couple kept their kids
isolated from the world beyond the family. I was even more curious why
the father, a very unpleasant character, went to the trouble of
supplying the son with regular pussy. None of that is explained, sadly
(unless I missed it). This father character annoyed me most about the
violent lashing at this regular pussy at some point (I find such
arrogance unbearable). The earlier lashing was not as saddening since
the girl, the most rebellious of the three kids, happens to be an
asshole.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie is well-made, and got unusual dialog, and a weird story. The
acting is all good as well, and so is character development.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Decent humor and an interesting lead make this watchable. There is good
anticipation of whether or not the guy under study is a lunatic. The old
girlfriend is desirable (as is the lead), and the carefree boss gets
sweet at times, even if he is cardboard character. Weird small movie.
Loved the ending. Romance was done okay, even if it is too typical of
romantic comedies.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;A well-made and entertaining dark comedy with interesting performances.
The lead performance also brought pleasure to eye, though it was never
quite convincing. The character is admirable though: she maintained
courage despite the mental torture (threats, harsh accusations, and
deception), though I wish she should have said more... too often she
kept quite while questioned. The direction is powerful, and so is the
story.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

the Rome-like arena and the city. Not much else is interesting, least of

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/12-years-a-slave-2013/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;I expected a lot more, and got disappointed by the less-than-impressive
direction and script. Not even Chiwetel Ejiofor saves it, and he in fact
exposes his limitations as an actor, which is sad given I am something
of a fan... see him in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;redbelt-2007&quot;&gt;Redbelt&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Four Brothers&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; for example.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one interesting subplot is one involving the sex pet, whose fate is
less than desirable. Not that her performance is any excellent, nor her
scenes particularly well-made. She just happens to be in a rather unique
situation, and I like her face :)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may end up the most overrated movie of the year. There&#x27;s not much

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Very well-made, with good attention to detail, and a unique story-line.
The suspense is too much for my liking. I enjoyed performance of George
Clooney much.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;It got a great concept (the most original I&#x27;ve seen in a while) and
great visuals. But after the novelty wears off about half-way through,
there&#x27;s pretty much nothing left. I enjoyed the performance of Timothy
Spall, but his character was not well-developed. None of the other
characters are given quality treatment either.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I found the Niki Lauda character quite unusual (and curious), making it
the most interesting thing in the movie. The movie doesn&#x27;t have much
else going for it: I did not enjoy watching the portrayal of the rival
and his drama (same old boring playboy), and I am not a big fan of
racing cars.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I liked a few things:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The bridge sequence is a showcase of decent visual effects&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The massage lady gives a quality performance, though brief&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The homage paid to &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;final-destination-2000&quot;&gt;the first movie&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; in the franchise is very
welcome, almost iconising it&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The lead actor is damn beautiful and also not boring&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie is sadly not offering anything new, and the sudden murderous
behavior of one of the survivors serious stupid... very unconvincing. I
did like the performance of Tony Todd, though it was laughably
creepy... stupid.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I am in love with the voice and utterances of Bane, a physically
formidable villain in a mask. The movie is far bigger and more intense
than &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-dark-knight-2008&quot;&gt;the immediate predecessor&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. I also found it more entertaining (at
least on first viewing), and a lot less annoying, though nothing matches
the miracle that is Heath Ledger&#x27;s The Joker. The title character
sounds unconvincing with the silly voice, and the movie feels like a
mess. Maybe it&#x27;s just too long, and the writers too desperate to
impress. The stupid twist didn&#x27;t help.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;A very effective alternative to sleeping pills, but filled with curious
works of art, and some interestingly bizarre character designs. It is
pretty much pointless, but it was sort of interesting to watch the
super-cute gal go about her dreamy adventures. Of the creatures, none
was as annoying as the human-cat hybrids, none as scary as the bird-ape
hybrids, and none as original as the floating giants. I cannot remember
creatures as saddening as these giants. They alone make the entire movie
worth watching.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;A ridiculous plot twist (I do not mind being fooled, but this is going
too far), some smart-ass characters (I don&#x27;t mind such, but this also
goes too far, or maybe they are just not well-written), and an
uninteresting back-story stop this one from being more than a cheap
fantasy-thriller. Luckily it&#x27;s very entertaining, and got decent
performances, not to mention an extra-desirable police lady. My favorite
performance is the lady who gets hypnotized in an early scene. She&#x27;s
incredible.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;It is an entertaining movie, but lacks a well-developed story and
characters. Not even the acting is satisfactory, bar that of Matt Damon
(lead character) and &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;William_Fichtner&quot;&gt;William Fichtner&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (his boss). The actions of the
violent villains are not justified, and so are those of the Jodie Foster
villain. The leader of the revolutionry criminals is very unconvincing.
The movie also feels rushed. It&#x27;s a pity because it starts well, and is
well-made (the director made &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;district-9&quot;&gt;District 9&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; after all), complete with
great visual effects and action direction.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Watching &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;mandela-long-walk-to-freedom-2013&quot;&gt;Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; led me to check this one out,
whose existence I&#x27;ve been ignoring for a few years now. Sadly, I have
to say I didn&#x27;t miss much... it&#x27;s about as dull as they come, and
none of the elements are worthy of celebration (cinematography,
direction, acting, script, ...). The concept of exploring the life of
an icon through someone else&#x27;s eyes is something I appreciated about
&lt;em&gt;Cry Freedom&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, but then it helped if that someone else is actually
interesting (a heroic journalist). It&#x27;s not the case here (a
sympathetic prison guard). As for the icon in question (Nelson Mandela),
it doesn&#x27;t look like much effort was expended really. Not even an
attempt to make him look older, beyond some white shit on the actor&#x27;s
hair. WTF!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was also not much effort on the part of the two actors to speak
Xhosa (a major language in South Africa) in a half-convincing manner.
Most of the world won&#x27;t notice of course, but it still does matter...
it&#x27;s embarassing if you have any passing familiarity of the language.
Lazy!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Good cinematography, production design, sound, and performance of the
lady playing Zinzi. Horrible old-age make-up (check mom of Mandela, or
worse still, check the Mandela face when Zinzi visits him in jail...
embarrassing and unwatchable). Also, I didn&#x27;t see Mandela in the lead
performance (Idris Alba is not a very good performer, and is not
credible in the role).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story was very rushed, and it leaves one feeling too many details
were left out (there was no mention of Oliver Tambo or Albert Luthuli,
for example), and some very significant moments merely given passing
attention (Sharpeville and Soweto killings, for example). One thing that
could have helped is narration, or even flashbacks. One can argue that
you can&#x27;t fit everything in a single movie, but that would be an
excuse... I&#x27;ve seen biopics in which feel like they do justice to a
legend, recent examples being &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-iron-lady-2011&quot;&gt;The Iron Lady&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;lincoln-2012&quot;&gt;Lincoln&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;For a movie this expensive, I found none of the visual effects
impressive. Not even the designs, both creature and mechanical, deserve
applause. The battles were entertaining, but too erratic to keep track
of what&#x27;s goin on. The story concept is retarded, making it a blatant
excuse to put giant robots on screen who didn&#x27;t happen to be
&lt;em&gt;Transformers&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. I also wish there was an explanation for the whole
thing, beyond the too-brief and nonsensical alien invasion story. Not
one performance was beyond average, nor was any of the humor effective.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, is there anything to celebrate here? Well... it&#x27;s not boring.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;The visual design is amazing, and it made sense seeing that it was Zack
Snyder at the top, the same director who brought us the visual
masterpiece that is &lt;em&gt;300&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. The movie has a weird feel to it, being such
a dark (and dull) re-imagining of the world&#x27;s most recognizable comic
superhero. It has incredible visual effects, some of which represents
the most epic hand-to-hand combat sequences ever put on screen. The
Superman suit looks amazing!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The villain (Zod) performance is very fitting, and so is the lead
(Superman). I wish the reporter lady died at some point, or at least not
placed in situations so dangerous. Regardless, it&#x27;s also a good
performance. I wish they had cast different people in place of Kevin
Costner and Russell Crowe.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;The family-focus thing is boring, and so is the overly-heroic antics of
the not-so-interesting lead. The story also feels incomplete, and I&#x27;ve
seen superior treatment of the subject matter (of pandemics)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a more positive note, I have never seen zombies so vicious. Also, the
movie is not boring.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

cinematography, direction, and cast, especially John Malkovich, who
gives his best performance I&#x27;ve yet seen. The story itself is okay
enough, but I enjoyed it a lot more on the first viewing. I also enjoyed
Angelina Jolie&#x27;s performance as grieving mother on that first viewing
than on this revisit, even going as far as calling it her best yet.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;It is reasonably entertaining, the animation is sophisticated, and
visual design is of good quality, but it suffers from relying too much
on recycled material, most notably from &lt;em&gt;The Incredibles&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and
&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;megamind-2010&quot;&gt;Megamind&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. I must not fault it too much for its direction, which is
also typical of so many expensive 3D-animated movies, including the
above-mentioned ones. Even the character design is not fresh, though I
did like one character... the giant gal. She is also not an original
concept (see Eva in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;igor-2008&quot;&gt;Igor&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;), but then again I&#x27;m a sucker for misfits

                <description>&lt;p&gt;1st review:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fantasy that is extremely funny in places and very entertaining
everywhere else. I found the rich man&#x27;s wife irresistible. In the
movie&#x27;s funniest moment, the ultra-dumb protagonist didn&#x27;t find her
so attractive.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;everywhere else&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; isn&#x27;t exactly accurate, since I found the moments
before the lead leaves the house quite boring. Also, I didn&#x27;t find the
lady &lt;em&gt;that&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; delicious this time around. It remains a special movie, and
kinda edgy, since you keep getting worried if anyone would actually
discover that our hero is actually a retard.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I am a fan of action sequences in movies, but only if the complexity is
kept to some limit. Too often, A-class movies add a lot of complexity to
the mix, as if that equates to excellence, or increases chances of
selling more tickets. Here&#x27;s examples from the most guilty:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;The chase sequence in the Arab city is among the most complex action
sequences I have seen in any movie. This isn&#x27;t praise... &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;overly-complex-action-sequences&quot;&gt;I&#x27;m not a
fan of such excess&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and this must have been seriously expensive. The
rest of it is moderately interesting, and the animation highly-detailed,
and at times highly-sophisticated. It did not, however, result in any
wow moment, but I appreciate the one detail of the Captain&#x27;s convincing
eyes near the end.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Not very interesting, except for the scene with the child killer, which
is a showcase of visual mastery... one of the best (and most original)
character designs I&#x27;ve seen. I also enjoyed the moments with the faun
character, who also represents good character design.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;First review:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has a similar feel to &lt;em&gt;Taken&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and is also set in dark Europe and
stars the very capable Liam Neeson. The storyline is solid and so is
the acting. There is a lack of gloss, and it&#x27;s very edgy. The twist
is pretty good and so is the action, although it&#x27;s not kool when you
see an untrained person suddenly capable of driving a car like a
stuntman. Writers this good could have come up with something better.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It feels a lot worse, which is yet another instance of &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-case-of-the-matrix-reloaded&quot;&gt;The case of
&#x27;The Matrix Reloaded&#x27;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. It&#x27;s not as interesting, it does not feel
like &lt;em&gt;Taken&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, it&#x27;s not set in dark Europe, the twist not too
interesting (unless it&#x27;s your first time), and the untrained life-saver
merely irritating.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/warrior-2011/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;The two toughest guys, the brother and the Russian guy, are scary as
fuck. The military back-story felt a little tired, and if anything, just
made the movie longer. It was done quite well though, so am not
complaining (much).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The teacher guy gives a very nice performance, and so is the wife. Nick
Nolte (the father character) does the usual, boring, business-as-usual
performance.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conclusion feels far-fetched, with the predictable-ness that is all
too common in sports movies, but the entire thing is very well-made and
has real nice fight choreography.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/lincoln-2012/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Very well-made, with solid dialog. This dialog (and script) is also
unusual, an example being the opening scene which, though interesting,
felt like an attempt to be different. It did work for sure, since I
enjoyed it enough to think the movie was going to end up excellent.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story focuses on the greatest accomplishment of Abraham Lincoln, a
man who I have, for a long time, greatly admired. One thing that&#x27;s
strange is that this guy appears to be just one of the guys,
distinguishing himself only through his smarts when he speaks. It also
doesn&#x27;t help that there is no visible security surrounding him to
indicate he is indeed the most powerful person in a country of millions.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <pubDate>Sat, 07 Sep 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
                <link>http://tshepang.net/kung-fu-panda-2008/</link>
                <guid>http://tshepang.net/kung-fu-panda-2008/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;1st review:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#x27;s a tremendous amount of fun to be had in &lt;em&gt;Kung Fu Panda&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, a
superb crowd-pleaser with some of the greatest action I&#x27;ve seen of
any movie. The filmmakers&#x27; taste however varies from mine; I
wouldn&#x27;t have chosen animals, some of which are simply a result of
eccentricity, and which I suspect to have been deliberate.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a third viewing, I still find the action impressive, but would not go
as far as &lt;em&gt;among the greatest&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. The lead character tends to be annoying,
partly because he&#x27;s used to legitimize lying (which is way too common
in movies), and partly due to the slapstick humor. He also survives way
too much physical pounding, and without a scratch. The movie is also
shallow.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the great feats of character development is having the audience
care about a cruel villain. Here&#x27;s a few movies that has such villains:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The peackock in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;kung-fu-panda-2-2011&quot;&gt;Kung Fu Panda 2&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lead of pirates in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;captain-phillips-2013&quot;&gt;Captain Phillips&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;This is unique in that movies showing The White House being attacked are
very rare. I can only remember one in fact, &lt;em&gt;Independence Day&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. I also
saw this concept explored only once elsewhere... one of the seasons of
&lt;em&gt;24&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; (a favorite of mine). The amount of violence is quite unexpected,
and very sudden, though it could have went even further (e.g. killing
son of president). The overall movie, however, feels... inadequate. It
lacks interesting performances, and the acts of the villains are left
pretty much unexplained. The pro-American stance, &amp;quot;we will emerge
victorious no matter what&amp;quot;, is intensely annoying, though not to the
levels of &lt;em&gt;Independence Day&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Smeagol&#x2F;Gollum is among the legendary movie characters, and I felt he
was a welcome addition to the movie. He&#x27;s as annoying as usual, but I
did like the faces he made during the game he played with the title
character, which I think were more varied&#x2F;complex than he had in &lt;em&gt;The
Lord of the Rings&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; trilogy. I also enjoyed the character of the
eccentric animal-lover wizard. The trolls (ugly, disgusting giants)
represent great character design and so do the orcs, complete with their
wolves. Pity none of it is actually new. &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;overly-complex-action-sequences&quot;&gt;I dislike the excessive
complexity of the battle scene&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;... serious waste of money and effort. I
also hate it when characters go through way too much physical pounding,
as in when the rock giants fight (a ridiculous and unexplained moment),
and the Dwarf escape.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I hate it when characters that do not have supernatural powers survive
great pounding, being thrown against walls being the most popular form.
It cannot be too hard to avoid such situations as a writer, but it
remains common, which reduces the feeling of realism, and makes me sad.
Here&#x27;s some examples:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The cave fall in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-hobbit-an-unexpected-journey-2012&quot;&gt;The Hobbit - An Unexpected Journey&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; must be the
most egregious I&#x27;ve seen yet.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;For my most anticipated movie of this year, this was
less-than-impressive. I did not like seeing Tony Stark having impressive
physical abilities (which was excused by some evidence of martial arts
training), or the uninteresting idea of flaming villains (though the
Pepper entrance was fun), or the whole story in general. Felt like mere
opportunism (milking the franchise), and the abilities of the suit keep
growing more and more, to ludicrous levels: In the second movie, the
portable suit idea was kool, and so was the &lt;em&gt;magnetic&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; one in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-avengers-2012&quot;&gt;The
Avengers&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. The remote-driven one in this third one is also a nice touch,
but when it gets to the point of its individual parts flying themselves,
I get to wish the filmmakers put a reasonable limit to the fantasy.
Also, what&#x27;s with the boy genius thing? What&#x27;s the chances of
accidentally meeting such? Are the writers so untalented?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was still a fun movie, but it makes me miss the freshness of the
first movie and the villain of the second; apart from being
unconvincing, the primary one here, played by Guy Pearce, is also not
interesting.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;This one has the special distinction of having a body double being the
lead character, something I haven&#x27;t seen before. It&#x27;s just sad that
the performance (all them actually) isn&#x27;t so good, and neither is the
story and direction. It&#x27;s a second-rate production.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Exposing the shit life of being an illegal immigrant (and the associated
poverty, where people go as far as selling own body parts). I watched
this due to the appearance of Chiwetel Ejiofor, who plays the lead
character. The character development is pretty good (check the friend
that works at the morgue, or the guy infected by some sexually
transmitted disease).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

provides what&#x27;s easily the movie&#x27;s most interesting performance. The
movie&#x27;s climax is rather outrageous, and bordering on embarrassing. The
movie remains a worthy addition to those which criticize oppression
based on gender. This Chiwetel guy is also kinda pretty.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a nice find. I bumped onto it by accident. The first scene got
me sold (gritty, with good performances, especially the amazing Chiwetel
Ejiofor, as well as good direction). It does not disappoint throughout,
and it&#x27;s amazingly unpredictable. I wish it could have been longer,
with more of the loose ends tied.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;It is entertaining throughout its entire 140+ minute run-time, but it
feels like a desperate attempt to be trendy&#x2F;stylish. See for example
going for the gorgeous Salma Hayek as lead villain, or the three-some
thing. Brutality is fine in movies (scary shit keeps me on
edge-of-seat), but the rape scene was just not needed. Anyways, this
isn&#x27;t serious film-making.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I saw this first time some years ago, and it remains a quality movie.
Pity that it doesn&#x27;t quite reach the levels it attempted to. It&#x27;s
well-made of course, with some decent performances. I just don&#x27;t know
what the point of it all is. For example, it sounds like someone was
desperate to have us look at the good side of the racist police officer.
It felt a little desperate. Also, why have the robber get shot by the
good cop? Anyways, I did like the prelude to the first robbery scene.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;The most brutal slavery movie I&#x27;ve seen yet, though peppered with humor
all over the place: it&#x27;s a dark comedy&#x2F;satire, which is a rather daring
approach considering the subject material. It&#x27;s interesting to note the
cruelty Black people here face, which isn&#x27;t better than that of farm
animals. Makes me feel guilty for eating meat, much like &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rogerebert.com&#x2F;reviews&#x2F;farewell-uncle-tom-1972&quot;&gt;Roger Ebert
makes me feel&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for calling this movie good.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish more effort should have been made to make the blood more
convincing. The weirdness of the final scenes, those shot in modern
days, isn&#x27;t welcome either. They are too eccentric and meaningless.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Here&#x27;s what a revisit felt like, back in 2010:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It didn&#x27;t pack as much of a punch as before. It even felt barren.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was hoping that the third viewing would be more pleasant, but it&#x27;s
still the same as the second. It is sad because I really enjoyed this
movie on first viewing. It remains an important movie of course, not to
mention being the best David Straithairn moment yet. The camerawork is
also simple, yet effective.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <title>Network (1976)</title>
                <pubDate>Sun, 07 Jul 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
                <link>http://tshepang.net/network-1976/</link>
                <guid>http://tshepang.net/network-1976/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Here&#x27;s what I wrote in 2009:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a strong satire like &lt;em&gt;Network&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, complete with powerful appearances
by Faye Dunaway and Robert Duvall, one tends to wish the entire thing
was shot and edited at least as well as it&#x27;s mightier counterpart,
&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;dr-strangelove-1964&quot;&gt;Dr. Strangelove&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. It&#x27;s got quite some heavy-handed dialog that may
have inspired the superior and much younger &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;good-night-and-good-luck-2005&quot;&gt;Good Night &amp;amp; Good Luck&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.
What&#x27;s also commendable is that the one voice of sane reason actually
is offered by a man who is likely more cruel than all others in the
story (bar those in the last meeting of course, a moment which would
be a spoiler if revealed).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A revisit, as usual, didn&#x27;t impress as much. I still appreciate the
humor and satire, but the fact that it made me feel asleep is not a good
thing. I didn&#x27;t even enjoy the two performances I so praised above. I
don&#x27;t even remember who I was referring to by &lt;em&gt;one voice of sane
reason&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, and the latter movie I mentioned is a lesser movie overall. One
thing I still celebrate though is that very last scene... the meeting.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;A very enjoyable story with some very interesting performances, most
notably that of &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tom_Towles&quot;&gt;Tom Towles&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, who plays a rather disgusting character,
Otis. AFAIR, this is the only one of his performances I ever enjoyed,
and he&#x27;s just perfect. &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Michael_Rooker&quot;&gt;Michael Rooker&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is also a joy to watch, and
despite his incredible cruelty, remains a guy we all care for, perhaps
due to his care for the (delightful) leading lady.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/the-king-2005/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;There is no shortage of good performances (I enjoyed watching the sweet
&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Pell_James&quot;&gt;Pell James&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and the beautiful &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Laura_Harring&quot;&gt;Laura Harring&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, but none was nearly as
good as &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Paul_Dano&quot;&gt;Paul Dano&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;). That and a strange and unpredictable (and often
edgy) script, as well as the excellent direction (check for example the
long shot near the end) makes for a very good watch.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would have been nice if the villainous behavior of one of the
characters was explained, or the ending not leave me speculating.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Well-directed robbery scenes and well-written story, but nothing really
new. I liked the nun costumes, and loved performance of &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Jeremy_Renner&quot;&gt;Jeremy Renner&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <title>Cleanskin (2012)</title>
                <pubDate>Sat, 20 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
                <link>http://tshepang.net/cleanskin-2012/</link>
                <guid>http://tshepang.net/cleanskin-2012/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;This would have been excellent had it not dwelled so much on the
terrorist guy. I did find his appearance refreshing at first (a fresh
and beautiful face, and a solid performance), but he&#x27;s simply not lead
character material. This is unlike the Sean Bean character, who gives a
very fitting character and performance.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first several moments are entrancing, and compete favorably in terms
of execution (and grit) against far more expensive productions like
those in the &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bourne_(film_series)&quot;&gt;Bourne series&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one weak spot in the movie is the beheader character. He was
supposed to be menacing and heartless, but he looks more fit for a
lesser movie, and the moment involving the baby was simply needless.
Luckily there is no shortage of superb acting, most notably from the
lady in charge, &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Charlotte_Rampling&quot;&gt;Charlotte Rampling&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <title>The Thaw (2009)</title>
                <pubDate>Sat, 20 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
                <link>http://tshepang.net/the-thaw-2009/</link>
                <guid>http://tshepang.net/the-thaw-2009/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;A very edgy take on existential risk, this time the villain being a
parasite, which is a fresh break from the usual global war or virus.
Watching it, I thought of &lt;em&gt;Contagion&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; (virus), an overall superior
movie, which was on a far grander scale (and budget). But this one is
more unsettling given it&#x27;s various horror movie elements, except
handled with far greater skill than horror movies normally get.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All performances are of at least decent quality, my favorite being that
of Val Kilmer. He was always good, but he seems to get better with age
(see him in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;felon-2008&quot;&gt;Felon&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;). I also liked the Asian gal and the Black guy (an
unusual performance, and a fresh face).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;My brother trashed this one, so I watched anticipating the badness, but
it just didn&#x27;t come. Sure 50 Cent (playing Jonas) struggles to speak,
but I thought he is a formiddable figure enough to forgive the lack of
talent. The rest of the performances are pretty good, but I&#x27;m tired of
watching the no-longer-interesting Robert De Niro. The character
development is also of good quality, and was best expressed when Jonas&#x27;
friends were shown around on their first day at work. The movie did feel
rushed though, and I was actually hungry for more of the racist guy. The
direction is very edgy, keeping me tense for a large portion of the
movie. The storyline is also unusual, and the middle-aged lady totally
edible.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;If we ignore certain arbitrary and stupid happenings, this movie is
quite well-made and has some decent dialog. It also feels fresh,
especially in the first half. It&#x27;s also the scariest movie I&#x27;ve seen
in a few years (if memory serves well), even though some of the scares
use tired techniques like loud sounds and sudden appearances of scary
figures.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish the lead could have been chosen for her talent instead of her
cuteness level.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <title>Payback: Straight Up (2006)</title>
                <pubDate>Sun, 31 Mar 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
                <link>http://tshepang.net/payback-straight-up-2006/</link>
                <guid>http://tshepang.net/payback-straight-up-2006/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the most extensive Director&#x27;s Cut I&#x27;ve seen yet. There is so
much that is different:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most regretful is the absence of the Kris Kristofferson character,
whose role of head of The Outfit is replaced by a female voice. This
itself isn&#x27;t so bad, if we ignore that Kris was amazing to watch,
most especially the moment he first appeared on screen (amazing
direction).&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is one moment of domestic abuse that is rather hard to
swallow. I thought it was quite daring (and surprising), especially
because a character we are supposed to like is the perpetrator. This
moment alone makes it understandable why it was edited out.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ending is a lot different and more involved (and perhaps a bit
over-the-top), but superior overall.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two of the bodyguards were totally removed from the original cut,
which is rather sad for they given wonderful performances (they look
mean as fuck). I am referring to the two who drive the Val Resnick
character about.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I could be wrong, but I felt like there were more shots of the
city&#x27;s environment, which makes me appreciate the great production
design both movies display. Wonderful.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first scene from the earlier movie, the one in which Potter is
getting bullets removed from his body, is missing. It&#x27;s among my
favorite scenes, and displays very well the darkness the movie
explores, complete with a curious medical practitioner.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The lead character&#x27;s voice-over is missing, and was actually quite
good. This version proves it wasn&#x27;t essential though.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I find &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;payback-1999&quot;&gt;the earlier release&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; superior, but not by a big margin.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <title>Silent Hill (2006)</title>
                <pubDate>Fri, 29 Mar 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
                <link>http://tshepang.net/silent-hill-2006/</link>
                <guid>http://tshepang.net/silent-hill-2006/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Some of the creature design which is quite good, best of which is
&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Pyramid_Head&quot;&gt;Pyramid Head&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, the horrific blade-dragging monster, whose made even
more memorable by his countless bug-like companions. Second favorites
are the supersexy, faceless, murderous &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;silenthill.wikia.com&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Nurse&quot;&gt;nurses&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. These pleasures were
however spoiled by a miscast&#x2F;unconvincing villainous lady and the weak
story. This is not to mention random stupid things, like the leading
lady running away from the cop for no reason, or the silly gal whose
hate leads to her being skinned alive, etc.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is how I felt first time I watched it, and is no longer the case:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deserving of mention is the superb production design (though this is
inconsistent) and certain moments of extreme beauty (e.g. the early
scene of the grassy wilderness where mother and daughter share some
love, and a later scene which shows the internals of the family&#x27;s
home). As for visual effects, the moments of &amp;quot;approaching darkness&amp;quot;
can only be a result of visual mastery.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That early scene was nice yes, but calling it &lt;em&gt;extremely beautiful&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is
extreme. As for the visual mastery comment, it must have been mere
virgin excitement.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <title>Silent Hill: Revelation (2012)</title>
                <pubDate>Fri, 29 Mar 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
                <link>http://tshepang.net/silent-hill-revelation-2012/</link>
                <guid>http://tshepang.net/silent-hill-revelation-2012/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Pyramid_Head&quot;&gt;Pyramid Head&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is back, this time with someone tough enough to fight
him. This someone is the superbly-designed blade-headed slasher
character, known as &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;silenthill.wikia.com&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Missionary_(film)&quot;&gt;The Missionary&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (and obviously deserving of a
better name). This is among the most impressive creature&#x2F;character
designs I&#x27;ve yet seen in movies, and nearly as innovative as Mr. Head,
and arguably more dangerous, given her speed. The murderous &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;silenthill.wikia.com&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Nurse&quot;&gt;nurses&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; are
also back, this time even more glorious than before.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, there is nearly nothing else to celebrate... the direction is
quite bad (deceptive and erratic camerawork and editing with annoying
overuse of the tired trademark of horror movies... loud sounds). The
leading lady, and his boyfriend, are not interesting. Sean Bean is a
good actor, but is seriously miscast, as he was in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;silent-hill-2006&quot;&gt;the previous movie&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.
There&#x27;s lots of meh dialog, but I really did love the leading lady&#x27;s
moment in the classroom, which is something I&#x27;ve never seen before in
movies. But because the script isn&#x27;t solid, her attitude (and strength
of character) was left unexplained, and is simply over-the-top.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Well-made and interesting, but pointless. Maria Bello is as good as
usual while Virgo Mortensen gives a poor performance. The kid playing
their son is impressive, and so was the brutal duo, who ended up trying
to rob the wrong guy.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;The movie is well-made, and has an exciting twist. The eveil acts done
by two of the characters needed better explanation, most especially the
first one (it was too sudden). I enjoyed watching the detective... nice
performance there.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gorgeous gal is a lot more appealing when she&#x27;s a cashier, as was
the case with Amy Smart as waiter in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-butterfly-effect-2004&quot;&gt;The Butterfly Effect&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, another
movie which tackled the alternative reality concept.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Scathing, well-made satire; excellent and exciting during its first
half, and a slow-down in the second, with the usual consequences thing,
not to mention the annoying Jared Leto character. If only the movie kept
the delicious pace, and if only it kept the length at 100 minutes or
so...&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is Eamonn Walker&#x27;s best role, even though his performance didn&#x27;t
excite me as much as it did first time around; It was my most favorite
from among &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;2006-movie-review&quot;&gt;the movies I saw first time in 2006&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <title>Point Blank (1967)</title>
                <pubDate>Sun, 24 Mar 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/point-blank-1967/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;If you look past the ugliness of having been made in 1967 (awkward
direction and acting), it actually is interesting. This is partly with
the help of the lead, Lee Marvin (not exactly a good performance, but an
interesting one nevertheless), and partly with the help of his
character, due to his relentless pursuit for the money taken from him.
The flashbacks are badly made, complete with horrible editing. The scene
where his gal unleashes violence against him is memorable.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was led to this after finding out it&#x27;s based on the same material as
the later &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;payback-1999&quot;&gt;Payback&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, a far superior take.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Innovative story concept, excellent elements (direction, cinematography,
production design), ultra-desirable gal (Jennifer Connelly), impressive
make-up (The Strangers), and an interesting eccentric character played
by Kiefer Sutherland. The Strangers are given good performances, most
especially the one leading the search.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite all the goodness, the experience is marred by some shortcuts
taken by the writers, some continuity errors, an uninteresting lead, and
some bad visual effects, most evidently in the laughable final showdown.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <pubDate>Sat, 23 Mar 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

                <description>&lt;p&gt;It remains impressive after all this time:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The detective partners are a joy to watch, and remain my most
favorite pair in movie history. Superb character development and
humor.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The direction, set design, script, and cinematography are all
superb. It&#x27;s wonderful watching Porter, the lead character,
progress from level to level, all the way to the top of the
underworld.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The character of Val Resnick is the best-developed in the movie,
complete with a real good performance. His shining moment is an
outburst resulting from pride and fear.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The three heads of The Outfit represent more great character
development, and are honored with impressive performances, best of
which is Kris Kristofferson in what amounts to my most favorite of
his work, and a very memorable lead villain.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The two ladies in Porter&#x27;s life are given solid portrayals.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are some more nice appearances here and there, fat guy being
one, and his boss another.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, overall this is a real joyful experience, and my complaints aren&#x27;t
major:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mel Gibson gives a nice performance, but is not a convincing
bad&#x2F;tough guy; his narration is excellent though.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The final shootout involving the Orientals was just needless, and
its violence almost cartoonish.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;payback-straight-up-2006&quot;&gt;A Director&#x27;s Cut version&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; was released in 2006, and I loved it too.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <pubDate>Fri, 22 Mar 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/what-s-eating-gilbert-grape-1993/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Answer involves 2 challenges:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Living with a close relative suffering from extreme obesity.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Living with another close relative, suffering from mental
retardation.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes the movie important, even though it&#x27;s not especially good.
The romance, or rather the gal (the sort of character that is Juliette
Lewis&#x27; now-dated trademark), is not interesting, and most everything
else that happens (e.g. the cheating wife episode) just feels random and
needless.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did however like Crispin Glover&#x27;s performance and I wish he was given
more screen time.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Bizarre story (powerful beings screw around with affairs of entire
planets), and a hero with unexplained powers and flashbacks (unless I
missed the explanation). I do, however, appreciate superb character
design of the four-arm humanoids, even though their look and behavior is
similar to that of the giants of &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;avatar-2009&quot;&gt;Avatar&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Nothing fresh here as I expected, judging by the trailer. There is also
that annoying and all-too-common thing of someone lying and later
regretting and apologising in public. Movie is shallow too, and each
character recycled.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did like some of the dance sequences though (regardless of the badness
of the music), and I thought the dirty chef character was very
well-animated, and is a showcase of quality character design.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;One thing of note is the care regarding the impressive performance of
that dog; the training involved must have been quite involved. It&#x27;s
amazing. The movie&#x27;s best moment, though, is the fast-paced scene in
which the lead character narrates a summary of his writings (he is
newspaper columnist). I thought it was quite innovative, complete with
fun content.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond embracing pets, I thought the whole excercise was pointless. I
kept wondering, &amp;quot;Is this it? You sure this is all this movie is
about?&amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;It is overall a disappointing experience, considering I watched with
anticipation, given its &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;quantum-of-solace-2008&quot;&gt;solid predecessor&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. I however have to give
kudos to Daniel Craig&#x27;s befitting performance. I liked also the first
chase scene, which must have the most daring motorbike stunts I have yet
seen in movies, not to mention an unexpected ending. Most of the rest of
the movie does not live to the expectations set by that opening. The
story is not good either, nor the villain interesting.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/in-bruges-2008/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Far better than the more expensive and colorful later work of this
talented director, &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;seven-psychopaths-2012&quot;&gt;Seven Psychopaths&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Great camerawork, enjoyable
acting (including even from Colin Farrel, which must be my most favorite
of his career), superb script (and dialog), a gorgeous and intensely
desirable gal, unusual storyline, and, and... what a gem?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a bit of a lull partway through it, but soon after, the fun
continues, and builds up to an intense and unpredictable last act, which
does not feel rushed at all... it&#x27;s amazing. It&#x27;s also helped a lot
by the superb Ralph Fiennes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As in the above-mentioned movie, one can sense a work of a liberal
writer&#x2F;director, where there is also some mention (and elevation) of
inter-racial relationships, and condemnation of a racist character. More
importantly, there is an important character in a form of a dwarf (real
nice performance there, reminiscent of that of the superb &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Peter_Dinklage&quot;&gt;Peter
Dinklage&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; in the excellent TV series, &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;), though,
ironically, he is the racist in question (but later apologises for it).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <pubDate>Sun, 24 Feb 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
                <link>http://tshepang.net/taken-2-2012/</link>
                <guid>http://tshepang.net/taken-2-2012/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;A lame and desperate attempt to milk off the success of &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;taken-2008&quot;&gt;the first&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. It
did succeed though, but not artistically. It is a let-down in a number
of ways:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The classic silliness that is seen in too many action movies, like
leaving the hero unwatched for large periods of time, so as to give
him a chance to escape.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having inexperienced people perform miracles, like the supreme
driving skill of the daughter.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The lazy, overly-frantic editing technique that gives the illusion
that some hard-core action is taking place... the sort where you
cannot figure out exactly what is happening. You will often notice
continuity errors in such sequences.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The villain was also very uninteresting, and his utterances extremely
stupid and performance very unconvincing. A person at his level needs a
better script (or at least that is my idea of a high-ranking criminal).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I appreciated though is the great suspense the director
managed to pull off, especially during the first half. Also, I did not
find Liam Neeson as fearsome and convincing as the first time, but the
great efficiency of his character still impressed in a way, like when he
was guiding his daughter to find him.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;My favorite utterance from the movie:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A hooker comes out of the bathroom in a beautiful red dress. She says,
&amp;quot;Would you like to make love? Or, should we have an intelligent
conversation instead? I&#x27;ve been reading a lot of Noam Chomsky lately;
I think he&#x27;s a marvel&amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a very well-made dark comedy with some wonderful performances. My
favorites are &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tom_Waits&quot;&gt;Tom Waits&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and the Vietnamese psychopath. The latter also
happens to be the lucky guy who gets to experience some moments with
that one special hooker. I also loved the old lady in hospital, who also
happens to be gorgeous. Sam Rockwell, Christopher Walken, and Woody
Harrelson are impressive, but this is business-as-usual for them, so
nothing novel there.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Politically, the movie is important in that it does, in a rather subtle
way, condemn homophobia. It also promotes interracial romantic
relationships, which I always find beautiful.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;in-bruges-2008&quot;&gt;The earlier movie&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, written and directed by the same person, is a
superior work of art in many ways, though not as funny.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <link>http://tshepang.net/cube-zero-2004/</link>
                <guid>http://tshepang.net/cube-zero-2004/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;A rather disappointing, and possibly last, sequel of the series. I
suspect, when the writers set out to explore the intrigue in the
preceding movies (more &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;cube-1997&quot;&gt;the first&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, since &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;cube-2-hypercube&quot;&gt;the second&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; was just a
needless rehash), they did not actually have a solid idea how to explain
it... the actual purpose of the Cube. It is sad. Surely one could setup
brainstorming sessions about these things, especially if you are going
to spend a few million?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the execution in this case is not disgusting bad, and there is
okay acting, but the fascination is largely gone, and the excuse of an
explanation is merely a passing reference to patriotism and religion.
Also, the villain is not very impressive, despite a desperate attempt to
portray an eccentric evil character. It&#x27;s a far less successful attempt
than the a character he reminds me of: the genius scientist in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;afro-samurai-resurrection-2009&quot;&gt;Afro
Samurai: Resurrection&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;cube-1997&quot;&gt;first movie&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; had the advantage of freshness, and this one... well,
being a sequel can be real tough for movies, since they are often not
judged strictly as separate pieces of work, but rather something of a
continuation. That is, a movie can be superior technically (acting,
directing, writing) but still feel worse, due to lack of innovation&#x2F;loss
of novelty, or too much comparison with the first.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one sequel feels like a desperate attempt at continuing the
intrigue. It does have better acting, but worse dialog (or at least, not
as much fun). It feels desperate because now the Cube is like way too
advanced, bringing in some rather unfamiliar physics concepts into play,
feeling too unrealistic. The ending is weird, leaving me with questions,
and me wonders if it was delibarate on the part of the filmmakers, or if
I simply am not smart enough to figure WTF&#x27;s happenin.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;It may be a B-movie, but it does get intriguing at times, with quality
bits of dialog here and there. My favorite moment is when the smart gal
explains to the cop the complexity of the calculation he tries to force
her to perform. Solid piece of performance there.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The worst thing about the movie is the unexplained transformation into
villainy by one of the characters. Feels silly and desperate, as if the
writers were concerned the whole premise is not exciting enough, which
it is.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Bizarre treat, far more enjoyable in its first half. Lots of
bad&#x2F;uninteresting performances, even from established actors like Halle
Berry, Tom Hanks, and Hugo Weaving. Lots of brutality, pointlessness,
and... what the fuck is the movie about?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did enjoy the interview though, and it helps carry the movie along. I
enjoyed watching the guy asking the questions... decent performance
there. The guy rescuing the heroine is admirable too, though the action
he finds self in is just cartoony. Is this not supposed to be close to
reality?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some interesting quotables sprinkled all over the place. My
favorite is one uttered by a master composer after an attempt at a piano
by one apprentice:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You must have misheard me! I said I had a melody, not a malady!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <title>Dredd (2012)</title>
                <pubDate>Sun, 03 Feb 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/dredd-2012/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Not really a remake, nor even an alternative take, but more like &#x27;based
in the same universe&#x27;. Far smaller than &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;judge-dredd-1995&quot;&gt;the 1995 movie&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and a lot
less ambitious (and a lot better, which was not a feat at all). Much
lower budget, and visibly so, as well as poorer visual design. Could do
with a better director&#x2F;producer combo. But, the story is actually pretty
decent, and the suspense well-executed. The movie could do with a better
cast. The guy with the eyes does give a decent performance though, even
though he has too much of a Frodo character in LOTR (i.e. not fresh).
Also, the psychic lady is at least as pretty as she could act. The
villain, on the other hand, is not so convincing.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should be grateful that I didn&#x27;t get to see lead actor&#x27;s untalented
face, though I was exposed to the embarassing mimicry of the Sylvester
angry mouth.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <title>2012 movie review</title>
                <pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
                <link>http://tshepang.net/2012-movie-review/</link>
                <guid>http://tshepang.net/2012-movie-review/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;It is a pity that this year lacks any excellent movies, never mind a
masterpiece. This makes &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;2011-movie-review&quot;&gt;last year&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; far better and this among the worst.
This does not mean there was nothing to celebrate of course.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;visuals&quot;&gt;visuals&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best &lt;strong&gt;visual effects (overall)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-avengers-2012&quot;&gt;The Avengers&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;battleship-2012&quot;&gt;Battleship&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;harry-potter-and-the-order-of-the-phoenix-2007&quot;&gt;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of specifics, there was nothing better than the battle between
Voldermort and Dumbledore in that last listing, and the climactic battle
in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-avengers-2012&quot;&gt;The Avengers&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is runner-up.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best &lt;strong&gt;action&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is offered by &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-bourne-legacy-2012&quot;&gt;The Bourne Legacy&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-avengers-2012&quot;&gt;The
Avengers&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is its runner-up.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best &lt;strong&gt;hand-to-hand combat sequence&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is the fight that takes place
in a diner in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;haywire&quot;&gt;Haywire&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, followed by the protagonist fighting 2 assasins
in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-bourne-legacy-2012&quot;&gt;The Bourne Legacy&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best &lt;strong&gt;animation&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is, interestingly, an insert in (&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;harry-potter-and-the-deathly-hallows-part-1&quot;&gt;Harry Potter
and the Deathly Hallows, Part 1&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;), which tells the story of the Deathly
Hallows.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best &lt;strong&gt;opening credits sequence&#x2F;visuals&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; are from &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;true-legend-2010&quot;&gt;True Legend&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
followed by those from &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-girl-with-the-dragon-tattoo-2011&quot;&gt;The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. As for best
&lt;strong&gt;ending credits sequence&#x2F;visuals&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;, the honor goes to &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;harry-potter-and-the-half-blood-prince-2009&quot;&gt;Harry Potter and
the Half-Blood Prince&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I hate the movie, I have to admit that &lt;strong&gt;best production
design&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is found in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;j-edgar-2011&quot;&gt;J. Edgar&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;performances&quot;&gt;performances&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My &lt;strong&gt;favorite performance&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is that of Patrick Shai in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-bang-bang-club-2010&quot;&gt;The Bang Bang
Club&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. This is extra special since the guy comes from my country. The
runner-ups are Charlotte Gainsbourg (&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-science-of-sleep-2006&quot;&gt;The Science of Sleep&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;), followed
by the crippled guy in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;battleship-2012&quot;&gt;Battleship&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;best female performance&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is a tie between Annette Bening &amp;amp;
Julianne Moore in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-kids-are-all-right-2010&quot;&gt;The Kids Are All Right&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Runner-up is Charlotte
Gainsbourg in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-science-of-sleep-2006&quot;&gt;The Science of Sleep&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, who is just about the movie&#x27;s
saving grace.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best &lt;strong&gt;child performance&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is by Dakota Goyo, the son in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;real-steel-2011&quot;&gt;Real
Steel&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, while the best &lt;strong&gt;cast&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-iron-lady-2011&quot;&gt;The Iron Lady&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite &lt;strong&gt;voice acting&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is Tom Hardy (Bane) (&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-dark-knight-rises-2012&quot;&gt;The Dark Knight
Rises&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;), even though it&#x27;s hard to hear at times.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;characters&quot;&gt;characters&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best &lt;strong&gt;character development&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is the father of the title character
(Jack Lemmon) in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;missing-1982&quot;&gt;Missing&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, followed by the wife (Sissy Spacek) in the
same movie. My &lt;strong&gt;favorite character&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is however the son (&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Dakota_Goyo&quot;&gt;Dakota Goyo&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;)
in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;real-steel-2011&quot;&gt;Real Steel&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My &lt;strong&gt;favorite villain&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is the witch (Eva Green) in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;dark-shadows-2012&quot;&gt;Dark Shadows&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
runner-up being Bane (Tom Hardy) in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-dark-knight-rises-2012&quot;&gt;The Dark Knight Rises&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most &lt;strong&gt;desirable gal&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is Charlotte Gainsbourg as main love interest
&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-science-of-sleep-2006&quot;&gt;The Science of Sleep&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (I really loved this girl!). Here are the
runner-ups:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brooke White as wife and new mother (&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;change-of-plans-2011&quot;&gt;Change of Plans&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sissy Spacek as wife (&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;missing-1982&quot;&gt;Missing&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;best character design&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is the Chitauri, the alien race in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-avengers-2012&quot;&gt;The
Avengers&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best &lt;strong&gt;comic characters&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ken Jeong (&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-hangover-part-ii-2011&quot;&gt;The Hangover Part II&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lucy Punch (&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;bad-teacher-2011&quot;&gt;Bad Teacher&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Justin Timberlake (&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;bad-teacher-2011&quot;&gt;Bad Teacher&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;) (tie) master butler (&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;bob-the-butler-2005&quot;&gt;Bob the
Butler&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ben Stiller (&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;zoolander-2001&quot;&gt;Zoolander&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;worst asshole&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; was Marlon Brando&#x27;s character in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;a-streetcar-named-desire-1951&quot;&gt;A Streetcar
Named Desire&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;miscellaneous&quot;&gt;miscellaneous&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most &lt;strong&gt;funny&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; movies:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-dictator-2012&quot;&gt;The Dictator&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;horrible-bosses-2011&quot;&gt;Horrible Bosses&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-hangover-part-ii-2011&quot;&gt;The Hangover Part II&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;zoolander-2001&quot;&gt;Zoolander&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best &lt;strong&gt;script&#x2F;dialogue&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;missing-1982&quot;&gt;Missing&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best &lt;strong&gt;costume design&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; comes, surprisingly, from &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-great-dictator-1940&quot;&gt;The Great
Dictator&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each repeat of a movie is a different experience, hence the category,
&lt;strong&gt;best first-time viewing experience&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. This year, it&#x27;s won by the
year&#x27;s &lt;strong&gt;greatest spectacle&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-avengers-2012&quot;&gt;The Avengers&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Runner-up is &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;gone-baby-gone-2008&quot;&gt;Gone Baby
Gone&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and that&#x27;s because it was so gripping that I thought it would be
a great contender for best movie of the year. A revisit was not so
great.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most &lt;strong&gt;bizarre&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; movie is &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;battle-in-heaven-2005&quot;&gt;Battle In Heaven&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and the &lt;strong&gt;false
promise&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; award goes to &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;zombieland-2009&quot;&gt;Zombieland&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. It wins for being so exciting and
sorta fresh when it starts, but screwing up with lack of content later
on.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most &lt;strong&gt;overrated&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; movie is &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;a-nightmare-on-elm-street-1984&quot;&gt;A Nightmare on Elm Street&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, followed by
&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;a-streetcar-named-desire-1951&quot;&gt;A Streetcar Named Desire&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. That second is hailed a masterpice by weird
people.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;old-movies&quot;&gt;&#x27;old&#x27; movies&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section is meant to give a chance to movies I have watched before
this year to appear in this review, for one reason or another.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of those, the &lt;strong&gt;best experience&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; was offered by &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;being-john-malkovich-1999&quot;&gt;Being John Malkovich&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
which has now been elevated to a &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;tags&#x2F;masterpiece&quot;&gt;masterpiece&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Runner-up is &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;taken-2008&quot;&gt;Taken&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
which remains as intense and exciting as ever.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;fall from glory&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; award goes to:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;vicky-cristina-barcelona-2008&quot;&gt;Vicky Cristina Barcelona&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;: I enjoyed this massively first time I
watched it 2 years ago; it now feels pretentious and cheap&#x2F;shallow,
like something I would write if I were to try.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;perfume-2006&quot;&gt;Perfume&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;: It is sad that I used to consider this a masterpiece.
It remains good, just nowhere near the top.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;The worst in the trilogy, it makes one appreciate its &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;x-men-2-2003&quot;&gt;immediate
predecessor&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; even more. It is also heavily populated with characters,
many new, but they are mostly shallow. Both the script and direction are
far poorer than one would hope. It is full of lame utterances and
uninteresting performances, all but from the super-fast lady, the
Aaliyah (dead RnB artist) looklike, played by &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Dania_Ramirez&quot;&gt;Dania Ramirez&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;A decent attempt at telling the origins of Magneto and Xavier, their
meeting feels forced. It is good entertainment, but none of it is
outstanding at all. The visual effects aren&#x27;t any groundbreaking as one
would hope from a spectacle such as this. The villain is not
interesting, and so are most characters, especially his followers, all
shallow as fuck.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;The worst in the X-Men movies, it just feels like an excuse to milk the
brand. Fact that the production was troubled probably explains it. None
of the visual effects are any good, and the location of the final fight,
top of the cooling towers, was quite stupid... why did Wolverine go
there? Also, why did my favorite guy had to wear such a stupid and
unconvincing fat suit? Horrible!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I remember loving the first scene, in which some teleporting character
manages to infiltrate the White House. That, by the way, is my most
favorite of characters in the movie, followed by the gorgeous mutant
with the same powers as Wolverine. It is a pity she dies like that. I
also loved Mystique, whose abilities are ridiculously impressive. There
are so many characters, and the movie handles them really well, which
reminds me pretty much of &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-avengers-2012&quot;&gt;The Avengers&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Like that movie, you don&#x27;t
feel like any character is left under-explored.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One other thing is the movie is by far better than &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;x-men-2000&quot;&gt;the original&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and
in many ways. That is a strange fact, especially given it&#x27;s the same
director responsible. It is easily the best of the X-Men movies.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;As a kid, I was big fan of X-Men. That is why it was such a
disappointment to watch this movie (about a decade ago). I was hoping
for impressive effects and interesting characters, but instead got an
uninteresting Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, and too much of a focus on the
Anna Paquin character, Rogue. I remember been saddened by Halle Berry&#x27;s
performance, perhaps because I was not a fan, but also because I was
also a fan of the character she plays, Storm, and she just didn&#x27;t do a
good job. There are decent performances by the old men playing the
leaders of the opposing factions, Xavier and Magneto. But even then, it
was business-as-usual for them.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Nearly a year after the initial viewing, I am a bit puzzled why I was so
impressed so much by this movie. It remains good, yes, but I went too
far by praising its direction, acting and cast, or even drawing
parallels with &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;se7en-1995&quot;&gt;Se7en&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I got right though was the twist:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The twist is silly, and just doesn&#x27;t justify everything that happened
before. It sucks when movie makers don&#x27;t know how to end a perfectly
good story. On a positive note, that&#x27;s when the lead character (Casey
Affleck) chooses to do a very noble act, making him truly admirable,
especially considering what he sacrificed.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, I was afraid a revisit would disappoint, especially because
this was the remaining movie I labeled &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;tags&#x2F;excellent&quot;&gt;excellent&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; in the entire year of
2012... it was going to be the best movie of the year. Sadly, not one
movie from that year went beyong the &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;tags&#x2F;good&quot;&gt;very good&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (7&#x2F;10) rating.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Weird why this gets such great accolades from top critics. Sure it&#x27;s
not bad and it&#x27;s actually well-made, but I don&#x27;t see anything that is
truly exceptional. It does however tell a very universal story,
regardless of familiarity with Japanese culture.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is extreme kindness and modesty in a widowed girl, often to a
point of ridiculousness, but then again such angels actually exist. My
favorite performance is that of the more pro-active&#x2F;talkative daughter,
one who scolds her father a bit about his drinking.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the acting, where the characters face the camera, is just
awkward, forcing one to notice lack of ability, most especially from the
lady playing the mother.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie was a lot less bearable on first viewing, due mainly to being
overly slow-paced, as well as being eventless. I did appreciate it more
on this revisit, perhaps because I could easily look past the stylistic
choice, and instead enjoy the ride where we get treated to quality
character development and a rather simple story sprinkled with extremely
polite people.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Robert Rodriguez is a strange director. He is a good director, but he
tends to deliberately screw up his movies with some nonsensical events.
He did this previously with &lt;em&gt;From Dusk till Dawn&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, where he would create
a quality setup, and then mess it all with lots of ugly creatures. He
does the same here, with lots of disgustingness, in a form of people
infected with something that turns them into zombies. It&#x27;s sad mostly
because there is nice camerawork, lots of quality acting (check
especially Josh Brolin as medical doctor), and lots of quality humor
(check the child and mother moment, as well as the first meeting with an
infected patient). It&#x27;s like some sort of &#x27;fuck you&#x27; from the
director.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;The character design (from the title character to the colorful trio of
cyborgs) is quite good. The action fight choreography is among the most
brutal and intense I&#x27;ve yet seen, though it is often hard to figure
what is happening, a trick that is too common in action movies. The
movie also possesses a curious (and effective) mixture of two worlds
foreign to each other, hip-hop and oriental martial arts culture. It&#x27;s
nicely spiced with the Samuel L. Jackson character, which helps bring
some humanity to an otherwise dark storyline.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;A harrowing tale of a woman yearning for freedom in poor and rural
China. It is a very meditative work, more powerful than &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;recent-movies-2009-05-04&quot;&gt;Raise the Red
Lantern&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and full of raw emotion (check especialy the guy who plays the
father, the movie&#x27;s strongest actor) and simple in terms of
storytelling. It also showcases the side of China I never really saw so
vividly displayed, the musical side. The movie is touching to the point
of tears.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amidst all the pain is at least one hilarious moment which involves
bed-wetting.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Never in my movie-watching history have I seen a character as dull as
the lead character here. The only one that comes close is that of
&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;crimson-gold-2003&quot;&gt;Crimson Gold&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. It also happens to be the most bizarre movie I have seen
this year. It explores sex in a way I have not seen before, in that we
get to see very unattractive characters (husband and wife) take part in
it. The way they are shot is also very suggestive, like the movie is
some sort of soft porn, only with superior direction.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie is also a more extreme form of a &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;romance-1999&quot;&gt;Romance&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, in that it was
probably inspired by it, both in terms of explicit sexual shots and very
slow and pro-longed takes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only characters that seem alive are the young gal (fucking gorgeous)
and her friends.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I dislike the overly-loud banging sounds, which mostly emanate from the
gunshots. This is from a very violent movie which cast Bruce Willis (he
should retire), and &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Joseph_Gordon-Levitt&quot;&gt;Joseph Gordon-Levitt&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, whose face should have been
left alone, especially since he does not resemble Bruce even a bit even
after all the non-sense is put on his face, digital or not.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am hoping this overrated non-sense will be the last time travel movie
ever made, since the concept is utter crap (nonsensical). The story
starts exciting enough but loses steam very soon after. None of the
perfomers are solid, especially Jeff Daniels as villain.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;With hilarious moments all over the place, much of which is unique,
fresh, and daring. The lead character, played by the brilliant comedian,
Sacha Baron Cohen, reminds me very much of the Adam Sandler&#x27;s in the
wonderful &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;many-recent-movies-2009-02-27&quot;&gt;You Don&#x27;t Mess With the Zohan&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, only a lot better. The movie
also has very good production design.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is one trashy scene where the lead helps deliver a child, but the
punchline actually makes it worth it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;The characters in this movie express sexual desire to levels most people
are not brave enough to, which is a bit of a plus. The peformances are
of decent quality, but the level of eccentricity of some of the
characters not so kool. Sure they are respectable for pushing the
boundaries, but there is also that thing called taste&#x2F;sense:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what the fuck is up with the girl with the shitty hairstyle&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the club owner (smart but not so interesting)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;or the therapist, whose outburst was not at all realistic, nor is
her stupid belief (women cannot orgasm) believable, especially for
someone who deals with workings of the mind.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is like the makers wanted something profound, but lacked the writing
talent. The ending is boring and the movie pointless, except insofar as
to push the boundaries in blurring the distinction between porn and
not-porn.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

he is cheating with is an extremely annoying ass who nearly tells on
her, not because he is moral, but because he is jealous. The character
is unbearable, and so is the performance. Another annoying character is
the delinquent friend, whose sole purpose must have been just that...
to annoy me. Another unpleasant character, though the only one that
seems sensible, is the strange bar man, perhaps because I could not
figure him out. He just feels so arbitrary, as does that delinquent
friend. One performance I enjoyed most was that of &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Timothy_Spall&quot;&gt;Timothy Spall&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. It
was likely the first time I ever saw him (I saw this movie first time
several years ago), which is something that instantly earned him my
respect.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The writers did quite well in terms of character development here, but
not so well on the entertainment side, which is an even more important
attribute. Movies are, after all, primarily meant to entertain. In too
many places, the movie is hard to bear, and it would be quite strange if
anyone involved actually enjoyed the experience of making it. It is all
humorless and dull, and full of pain, and disturbed characters.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;The imagery imagined by the lead character, one where women expose their
lower bodies for the pleasure of men they cannot see, is powerful. It
has stayed with me for years, and is one of the main reasons I watched
the movie again, though it lasts less than a minute.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie itself is pointless, and feels like a waste of time. The
characters that are given a chance to speak blubber way too much
philosophical non-sense. Many of the scenes are tiring, for example
showing the entire sequence of a woman undressing, or being bonded for
sexual pleasure... twice. There is likely a message here, but am
perhaps too dumb to notice.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;The two facts, that the lead character is not Jason Bourne and that the
story occurs in parallel with the events in the Bourne trilogy, make for
very interesting narrative choices. I was not aware of this, so it was a
bit confusing until it was clear. Anyways, I am also very glad that the
new lead is quite capable, which is a relief since I was concerned,
considering I did not like him in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-avengers-2012&quot;&gt;The Avengers&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. He still is not a
match of Matt Damon though.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quality of the direction itself also matches that of the last two
movies in the trilogy, but the fight choreography is even better, among
the best I have seen in a non-martial arts movie. I did not like the
chase sequence so much, and the lead opponent could be better.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed this old-fashioned and take on fantasy heroism a lot more
first time I watched it, though I did find it pointless, and still do.
Even the lead villain isn&#x27;t as seductive. The animation could be
better, but the worst of it was the human faces. They should have made
it live-action, or better still, not made it at all. Or it just needed a
better writer. Some of the imagery was worthy of notice, especially the
water-on-skin effects. It was not ground-breaking though, at least to an
untrained eye like mine.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Watchmen is bizarre in a delightful manner, though it has annoying black
spots all over the place. One major one is everything about the
too-powerful shining guy (Mr Manhattan), and another is the bad old-age
make-up, so bad it may be deliberate.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bright spots make up for this:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the performance of The Comedian, especially the moment when he kills
a pregnant lady, pregnant with his child&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the equally affective one where the disguised face is exposed&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of brutality in the movie, including the supposedly-nice
protagonists breaking bones needlessly. The scene itself, where they get
attacked by some oriental guys, is stupid. Either that, or it is some
sort of parody, as is the case with the War Room thing, parodying a
(great) satire, &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;dr-strangelove-1964&quot;&gt;Dr. Strangelove&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one werid movie that I just don&#x27;t know how to place, so will
leave it here.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <title>Baise-moi (2000)</title>
                <pubDate>Mon, 17 Dec 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

                <description>&lt;p&gt;A low-key French-language and less cartoonish answer to &lt;em&gt;Natural Born
Killers&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. It also has affecting and believable performances and a
horrific, painful, and powerful story which also feels as random and
undirected as its two leads.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best performance is that of &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Raffa%C3%ABla_Anderson&quot;&gt;Raffaëla Anderson&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; as the more
trigger-happy of the 2 girls. It is sad that she has not done anything
else of significance, beyond porn.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one complaint I have is that the switch between &#x27;sad girls&#x27; to
&#x27;killer girls&#x27; is not really explained, and rather sudden.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <title>Buffalo Soldiers (2001)</title>
                <pubDate>Mon, 17 Dec 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
                <link>http://tshepang.net/buffalo-soldiers-2001/</link>
                <guid>http://tshepang.net/buffalo-soldiers-2001/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;My initial review:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s surprising that a movie as radical as Buffalo Soldiers could be
distributed at all since it&#x27;s about the most effective anti-war movie
I&#x27;ve seen in a long time. It&#x27;s filled with fresh acting, though the
movie&#x27;s villain doesn&#x27;t really convince while the lead character
could have been portrayed by a better actor (Phoenix isn&#x27;t
interesting at all).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A revisit was not so great, including the radicalness I felt, the
freshness of the acting (what was I thinking?), nor the anti-war
sentiment strong at all. I even went as far awarding it best story of
movies I watched first time in 2008, which is something a little
puzzling now. Instead, it just feels pointless and arbitrary.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <title>Sucker Punch (2011)</title>
                <pubDate>Mon, 17 Dec 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
                <link>http://tshepang.net/sucker-punch-2011/</link>
                <guid>http://tshepang.net/sucker-punch-2011/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;I was mesmerised by the imagery, and I don&#x27;t see why it would be
regarded any lesser than that of &lt;em&gt;300&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. It was interesting to discover
that the same director was responsible.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite of the fantasy scenes is the first battle scene, which has
three mean-looking &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;suckerpunch.wikia.com&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Samurai_Warriors&quot;&gt;Samurai Warriors&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. The envisioning was near-perfect,
and the visual and character design masterful, complete with excellent
visual effects and camerawork.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie in general is well-made, and has great production design. The
music is decent, though too loud, and so are the action scenes. I wish a
better action director was involved, since the lack of experience of the
girls shows. Perhaps there should have been more time spent in training
them. The director tries to make up for it with frantic visual tricks
(camerawork, editing, and visual effects).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;strong&gt;sidenote&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;] It&#x27;s interesting that what got me to watch this is
&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.time.com&#x2F;time&#x2F;specials&#x2F;packages&#x2F;article&#x2F;0,28804,2101344_2101366_2101545,00.html&quot;&gt;Time magazine&#x27;s Worst movies of 2011&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, of which this was number 2. It
just happens that I was attracted by the plot of alternate realities and
a pretty gal wearing a sword. I later on discovered that the movie was
generally poorly received, both commercially and critically. Weird.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <link>http://tshepang.net/syriana-2005/</link>
                <guid>http://tshepang.net/syriana-2005/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Here is my initial review:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Syriana is an uncompromising examination of government-sponsored
corporate evil and an idiotic oil-rich monarchy that condones it, with
a surprise ending. It&#x27;s a minimalist, yet powerful, narrative.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A revisit proved not as impressive, and I don&#x27;t remember what was
surprising about the ending. The quiet and distrinctive style of
direction gives it a fresh feel, although the quiet treatment tends to
make it boring in places.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all performances are interesting, especially the investigator with a
troubled housemate. I did not enjoy watching the middle-East kids
either.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I watched this only because of my great love for &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-butterfly-effect-2004&quot;&gt;its predecessor&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. It
feels like a student effort, and is just not interesting, and therefore
challenged my perseverance a bit.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did however like two of the characters, the criminals who want their
money back. The guys playing them give superb performances. One other
quality performance is that of company boss, while the best friend is
not so bad in parts.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Far better than its &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-butterfly-effect-2-2006&quot;&gt;immediate predecessor&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and a worthy successor to
&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-butterfly-effect-2004&quot;&gt;the original&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, this is a well-made and well-acted thriller with a
well-written script. The twist is interesting, though not entirely
convincing... feels forced. I enjoyed the performances of the 2
detectives, though no one was as good as overweight plant-loving
character, a sort of wise guide for the lead character. The &#x27;rape&#x27;
scene is superbly made.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <pubDate>Mon, 10 Dec 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
                <link>http://tshepang.net/the-avengers-2012/</link>
                <guid>http://tshepang.net/the-avengers-2012/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;I found &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;thor-2011&quot;&gt;Thor&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; very unsatisfactory, the 2 recent Hulk movies very
lacking, and &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;captain-america-the-first-avenger-2011&quot;&gt;Captain America&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; fairly bad. That&#x27;s why I was concerned
when I heard that my favorite comic book hero, Iron Man, would be paired
with them into one movie. I was also concerned by the fact that Jon
Favreau was not directing. Luckily the movie turned out a lot better
than I expected.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what makes it so good:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The movie is directed in a similar style to those 2 Iron Man movies,
including the clever humor and laid-back acting style.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The movie has some of the best visual effects I&#x27;ve seen yet, and
about as large-scale as any of the 3 &lt;em&gt;Transformers&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; movies, without
the overly-frantic action where you can&#x27;t figure WTF is going on.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I found the reaction of the city public refreshingly-realistic:
instead of watch and cheer the heroes, they run away from danger.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;This movie is one more reason I should probably stop paying attention to
the opinions of critics who get aggregated on Rotten Tomatoes. Most of
those who reviewed the movie actually felt &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rottentomatoes.com&#x2F;m&#x2F;nightmare_on_elm_street&quot;&gt;it was decent&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. One even
went as far as thinking the performances were any good. What the fuck! I
will be fair by admitting that the concept is actually good: people
getting attacked only when they fall asleep. I also liked some of the
visuals, like the gal who spins around and gets dragged around the room,
defying gravity. Everything else is plain bad, including the extremely
uninspired look and character development of the villain.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/total-recall-2012/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;The movie is so different from the first same-titled one from 1990 such
that it cannot really be called a remake. It is not quite as
interesting, and so are the lead actors (there is no Schwarzenegger or
Sharon Stone), does not take place in Mars (sadly) and is a
straight-forward thriller without any mind-fuck qualities the first one
had. The action was really overlong, and had the too-many hero-luck
moments, making it nearly unbearable towards the end.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some nice technology ideas I have not seen before:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Necklace that allows one to change appearance; by the way, the guy
the protagonist turns into gives a nice performance.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transport that goes through center of the planet straight to the
other side.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Small video cameras that attach themselves to surfaces, shot through
a gun.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And some I have seen:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;levitating cars (a few movies)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a machine that gives one convincing but fake memories (the first
&lt;em&gt;Total Recall&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

                <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;intial-review&quot;&gt;intial review&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Owls aren&#x27;t interesting animals at all, so I watched this in
preparation of moving on, but was captivated by the photo-realisitic
rendering of the birds&#x27; faces. I also enjoyed the humor offered by the
two birds that kidnapped the brothers, and that&#x27;s one other thing that
encouraged me to watch the rest.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie runs for around 100 minutes, but it feels very epic. It lacks
the immediate and glossy excitement of a Disney&#x2F;Pixar movie, and feels
more stately and serious, as well as darker. The characters are
well-developed and it doesn&#x27;t feel like shortcuts were taken, well
other than that the repeat trips felt shortened, much like Timon and
Pumba&#x27;s when they followed Simba back home. The battles are very
well-made, and the ocean waves, though brief, were quite impressive.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;revisit&quot;&gt;revisit&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did not experience any epicness second time around, nor did I notice
any outstanding character development. The eye candy was also not as
impressive. I also noticed annoying coincidences, as well as a far less
enjoyable experience.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;A very solid story with superb, but disturbing, direction. The concept
is among the best I have seen. The acting is top class, notably the
three leads: Guy Pearce, Carrie-Anne Moss, and Joe Pantoliano (in a role
that seems written especially for him). The twist sucks a bit
unfortunately, especially given that the lead appears to be a reasonable
character.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/no-country-for-old-men-2007/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;With tremendous suspense, superb performances, great cinematography as
well as immersive production design, this is easily the Coen Brother&#x27;s
best ever. The movie&#x27;s best scene is when the Josh Brolin character
explores the scene of the murdered gangsters; the atmospherics are
crying of perfection, and so is the execution of it all. Another thing
of note is the Coen&#x27;s love for the American South characterisations
(remember the touching &lt;em&gt;Raising Arizona&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;), and this is among the best
such treatments (e.g. check the guy who helps jumpstart the villain&#x27;s
vehicle).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kelly McDonald is a favorite here and not forgetting Brolin. And though
Tommy Lee Jones does a decent performance, I could have been happier
with someone else (he&#x27;s not a great favorite), and his role didn&#x27;t
need a superstar he is. The unflinchingly evil villain is fearsome, made
worse by his calm demeanor.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;A big let-down with a shallow and unexciting story, which is a strange
thing for a Disney theatrical release. This is made worse by my great
anticipation. Me was looking forward to something darker, as the poster
would suggest.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hair and fur is done quite well, and so was the bear fight.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;This is one of the rare old black &amp;amp; white movies that are actually
enjoyable throughout; it&#x27;s always a pleasure to revisit. The movie&#x27;s
greatest triumphs are it&#x27;s characters and performances, best of which
is Sterling Hayden as the mad general. One bonus performance is the guy
who is concerned about destroying property of the Coca Cola Company; and
he didn&#x27;t even look the idiot he was.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The attention-to-detail, regarding the procedures the guys in the bomber
plane follow, is impressive; the dialog is incredible.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;As was with his previous &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;breaking-the-waves-1996&quot;&gt;Breaking the Waves&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, Lars von Trier, the
director, also here lets his character go through much suffering, though
not portrayed in as painful a manner. This is helped by the enjoyable
musical moments, made all the better by the supreme voice and
compositions of Björk, who also plays that unlucky heroine.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relationship this protagonist of ours has with the prison guard is
quite touching. This is helped a lot by the portrayal of that guard, by
&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Siobhan_Fallon_Hogan&quot;&gt;Siobhan Fallon&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, who gives my most favorite performance of the movie.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;All performances are of good quality, best of which is the best friend
of the protagonist, who also happens to be a nurse. The movie is
otherwise unbearably boring, and me wonders why people punish themselves
by constructing such painful movies, especially ones so pointless. The
experience is made even worse by the ridiculous length of around 150
minutes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <title>There Will Be Blood (2007)</title>
                <pubDate>Thu, 22 Nov 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
                <link>http://tshepang.net/there-will-be-blood-2007/</link>
                <guid>http://tshepang.net/there-will-be-blood-2007/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Here is how I felt on first viewing:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before Daniel-Day Lewis&#x27; oil driller in &lt;em&gt;There Will Be Blood&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, I
don&#x27;t remember any other character in movie history as ruthless as Al
Pacino&#x27;s in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;recent-movies-2007-11-05&quot;&gt;Scarface&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;; Lewis&#x27; however is tougher, darker, and even
better-developed, rendering Pacino&#x27;s seem a mere maniac. None of the
other performances has any noticeable flaw either and the movie starts
like a masterpiece (the first few moments of silence showcases
top-class direction, the characters are amazing, etc.) and, though it
never lowers to the level of common fare, doesn&#x27;t quite reach the
pinnacle. The end leaves one wishing there could be more to the story,
perhaps a bit of color to an otherwise painful movie (there&#x27;s not a
single ray of light, bar the barely-explored romance of the lead&#x27;s
son). Interestingly, the entire work isn&#x27;t as depressing as the story
suggests, but rather more of an adventure, as well as a unique and
powerful exploration of mining life, not to mention a graphical
depiction of the dangers it entails.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a revisit, I take back the claim that Lewis&#x27; character is actually
tougher than Pacino&#x27;s. The rest of the review is still accurate though.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to add that the cast is among the best I have seen yet in
movies. In addition to the magnificent Lewis:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Paul_Dano&quot;&gt;Paul Dano&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; gives an incredible performance, one that is so good me
wonders if he can ever equal it.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Dillon_Freasier&quot;&gt;Dillon Frasier&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; gives among the most impressive child performances
ever. It is all the more impressive that this was his first
performance.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie could have done well with a different ending though, for the
one it has is a bit over-the-top, even though not pointless. This is not
to say it is not well-made of course, for it is in fact among the
best-made of all in the movie.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/pi-1997/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Darren Aronofsky, the director, uses the same unsettling camerawork and
editing style he later used in (the superior) &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;requiem-for-a-dream-2000&quot;&gt;Requiem for A Dream&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
with the aid of superb dialog and acting, notably Sean Gullette in a
lead role and Mark Margolis who plays the friend, and gives my most
favorite of his performances.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some unexplained things (e.g. the bleeding man, the brain),
unless it is a way of showing the mental suffering the lead character is
experiencing (&lt;strong&gt;update&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackexchange.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;9540&#x2F;105&quot;&gt;an explanation was given&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;). The movie starts
a lot better than it ends, and although made by a stylistic
master-director, there was at least two sleep-inducing moments.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Some nice performances by the kids, especially the explosives lover, the
lead character, the pretty gal, and my favorite, the movie director. I
loved also that of the guy playing the gal&#x27;s father. The train crash is
the movie&#x27;s best visual effects moment, and among the best crashes ever
in my movie-watching history. Character design of the creature, the
spider-like villain, could be a lot better.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;It is not really a supreme reboot, but it is an okay one. It does have
some exciting effects, and I most especially love the fights between the
hero and the villain. The love interest is not interesting, nor is any
of the characters who fill the movie. Well, maybe except the villain,
but only when in lizard form. The story is merely okay, and is bad at
times, e.g. the help the hero gets near the end with the cranes and all
(WTF!).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;The least interesting of the three movies in the series, complete with a
badly miscast Beyonce Knowles, who is even worse than Elizabeth Hurley
in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;austin-powers-international-man-of-mystery-1997&quot;&gt;the first one&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. This is made even worse by her failed tough 70&#x27;s
black gal persona, a bad parody of Foxy Brown. The most annoying, and
worst-developed, character however is the guy named Goldmember. What
were they thinking? Luckily, Fat Bustard is interesting this time
around, and so is the son of Dr. Evil.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;There is good humor here and there, some of which is unique. Check for
example the opening scene, and every musical and photo sequence. Trouble
is that some of the jokes just miss the spot, while the hilarity of some
totally disappear on a revisit.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One low point of the movie is the miscast Elizabeth Hurley, whose
persona (or acting ability) simply does not fit.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;The writers probably did not appear to care of looking silly, given the
amount of stupid events that happen (e.g. some oversized guy touches
crotch of another for some supernatural healing). The direction is
competent though, and so is some of the acting. My favorite was Sam
Rockwell even though he was not convincing in the role; he was just fun
to watch. Another good one was by &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Doug_Hutchison&quot;&gt;Doug Hutchison&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; as the hateful, and
easy-to-hate, prison guard. Michael Clark Duncan has an admirable body,
but am curious how it happened they decided to cast him for the role. It
is just so pointless, but I really love his body. Its size is however
inconsistently exagerrated.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Frank Langella, a decent actor, is a little embarassing when portraying
the infamous Richard Nixon. He does a caricature, and is given way too
much screen time, almost to a point where he is hard to bear. He must
have been having fun doing the performance, which must have been easy as
hell... stuff of comedies. The rest of the movie is very well-made and
does not bore for a minute.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the sad things of watching a movie based on actual events is the
tendnecy to wonder how much of it is fiction. As for this movie,
Wikipedia has &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Frost&#x2F;Nixon_(film)#Dramatic_license_and_factual_inaccuracies&quot;&gt;a nice collection of such cases&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;For a movie made in the sixties, I found the camerawork impressive.
Another feat is that the movie is entertaining for its entire running
length of 3 hours. Sadly there is too much idiocy&#x2F;retardation is some of
the characters, including that by the great Toshiro Mifune. I did
however love the movie&#x27;s most important scene, where his character
reveals his actual ancestry.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite part of the movie is the search for the samurai. I found the
characterisations of these warriors impressive. My favorite of them is
the quite one, who also happens to be the most skilled of the &#x27;seven&#x27;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;This was a lot more enjoyable when I first watched it several years ago,
though I remember nothing else of the experience, other than the
performance of Don Cheadle. It is the one movie that made me respect him
acting skills, though he never again repeated a performance this good
(in my experience). The rest of the story is mildly entertaining and the
movie did not age well.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Not intense enough to do justice to the subject matter, perhaps due to
being a little too unrealistic. It is however very well-made, has
quality cinematography and production design, and is well-acted. Forest
Whitaker is a pleasure to watch, as usual, Jude Law is damn gorgeous,
and the lady that plays his wife even more so. The girlfriend is not
interesting, sadly.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the subject matter, it would have been nice if there was some
explaination of how such cruelty came to be socially acceptable.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Quality direction, production design, cinematography, and cast. A decent
story which luckily doesn&#x27;t end in the tired way romances tend to be. I
enjoyed this more the first time around, mainly due to the sexuality
surrounding the man-whore and the rich lawyer. I enjoyed the
open-mindedness that she expressed, though she later on became
attached&#x2F;possessive enough to find the jealousy unbearable.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I liked the concept of the robo-bikes and... nothing else. The movie is
very unentertaining, and even disturbing at times. Not one character is
interesting, nor is any performance. The first two movies in the
franchise were a lot more watchable.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;It starts very well, with well-made visuals of zombie attacks, and a
nice play on &#x27;rules to survive&#x27;. It sadly gets messed when it&#x27;s clear
the writers did not know where to run with the story, and made even
worse by the sisters, who serve only to annoy, especially the older one.
Her failed attempt at sex appeal and sass does not help.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do however have to appreciate the moment where the Woody Harrelson
character expresses great admiration for Bill Murray.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;This is one of those strange movies that I enjoy heavily on first
viewing and fall bad on a second one. For example, I found the character
of Javier Bardem incredibly appealing, but saw a cheap and pretentious
character second time around, as if the overly self-conscious Woody
Allen was desperate to appease. As for Penélope Cruz, I praised her
profusely for her portrayal of the crazy-but-gifted ex-lover. Well, the
performance is good, but the appeal wore off, but it remains &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;favorite-of-career-performances&quot;&gt;my
favorite of her performances&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. I guess the main appeal of the movie is
the concept of open relationships (and frank sex talk).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;A fun ride that is unlike anything done before it. Calling it a
masterpiece would however be a lot more than it deserves. Sure it was
made by the best director ever, it has the supercool Justin Timberlake,
has a superb lead, and has quality acting, incredible camerawork, an
amazing script&#x2F;dialog, but that is just not enough. Perhaps it was just
not gripping enough, or the story appealing enough. It ends decently,
though not in any way one would expect.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Does not live up to the hype, some parts of the shallow story are
embarrassing, and the humor is recycled. The visual effects are meh, and
so is the costume design of the Asgards. Their city has a nice design
though, excessive as it is.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The title character is gorgeous as fuck. I also like the concept of the
mysterious gatekeeper, and the character. The silver robot is also
interesting.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed the movie more on a revisit.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I found this surprisingly laid-back, and more humorous than other Tim
Burton movies. The greatest pleasure offered is the villain, perhaps the
most interesting witch in movie history. Her cracked-skin nature is also
something fresh (me have not seen such before), her sexuality amazing,
her passive and quick-acting personality welcome (check for example how
she does not waste time to get to meet her old lover), and her beauty so
incredible that she can easily be forgiven for her great cruelty.
Another surprise is the sex scene, which I enjoyed a lot. Good humor
there.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;3 things I really like:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the narration&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the animated inserts, which are accompanied by that quality
narration&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the character design and development of the Vogons; my favorite is
the poet, and each second with him is a joy&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie, which is rather quirky and not too well-written (it feels
incomplete), toys around with some interesting ideas, and feels really
weird. It, at the end, feels pointless. The character of the president
of the universe, though entertaining at first, gets annoying later,
especially with the 2nd head thing. The gal, when in the shower, looks
incredible.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;This must be the weirdest of horror movies I&#x27;ve seen, and also
surprisingly highly rated. It still has those abused horror elements me
hates so much, and the only fresh thing it adds to the genre is the
characters who watch the victims in excitement. The leading gal is
extra-desirable but a little low on acting talent.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;It started pretty well, with nice humor, but the idiocy of a future
human civilization just went too far, and being a passive comedy is not
enough of an excuse for lazy writing.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I seriously enjoyed this dark comedy first time I watched. This was due
to the highly enjoyable performances of Pierce Brosnan (the assassin)
and Greg Kinnear (the much nicer guy). The freshness of the story even
led me to place it among the best movies I watched that year. On second
viewing, it started off very well, but the Pierce character, though
still very good (my favorite of all his work), just gets tiring with his
repeated self-deprecating speeches (&amp;quot;I am a mess&amp;quot;). Also, at times,
the character lacks believability. I also found the ending not too
satisfactory, that this assassin character would pull off the last job
so easily.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Superb direction ensures that we are kept on edge of seat for much of
the running length of the movie, and even the slow parts add to the
suspense. The lead detective is quite impressive, and I also enjoyed the
portrayal of the father of protagonist, as well as the (damn gorgeous)
wife of protagonist.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie opens with wonderful dialog, and the rest of it more than
lives up to the high standards that scene sets.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Special mention should go to the guy at the airport checkpoint. The
performance is amazing, though shortlived.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Pretty much enjoyable, complete with an interesting lead and an even
more interesting creation in the form of a sweet oversized monster, Eva.
The character design is of good quality (check each of the mad
scientists for example), but the sad moment, that in which the lead
reveals lies he told, sucks as much as it normally does in, for example,
romantic comedies. This heavily taints an otherwise good fantasy.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I was surprised that &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Man_of_the_Year_(2006_film)#Reception&quot;&gt;critics disliked this one&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for I enjoyed it much.
I found much of the humor great, and I found the performance of Robin
Williams wonderful. The romance however was not done very well, mainly
because the character of &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Laura_Linney&quot;&gt;Laura Linney&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, herself a very excellent
actress (remember &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;kinsey-2004&quot;&gt;Kinsey&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;), is very annoying.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those critics mentioned dislike of mixing the whole thing with
conspiracy, and in hindsight, it was quite unwarranted. The movie would
have done fine without it, and it was just not done right, and Jeff
Goldblum performance didn&#x27;t help either.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I went into this one with high anticipation, only to be met with lots of
careless direction, as if the thing was rushed. It is also the worst
performance of Charlize Theron in memory, and the only one I found
embarassing. However, the worst performance in the movie is that of the
lead character.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are isolated moments of beauty and decent visual effects. Not one
of the seven dwarfs are interesting, even though many were portrayed by
good actors. Why didn&#x27;t they use real dwafs?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Too often if happens that a movie starts promisingly well, and in this
case, with solid direction and exciting acting, but later on lulls you
into boredom, forcing you to keep checking how long is left before the
end. It remains good throughout of course, but the (extremely)
unconvincing performance of Ewan McGregor does not help at all. I kept
waiting for &#x27;his moment&#x27;, but it never comes. There&#x27;s also not a
proper explanation why the lead character, played by Jim Carrey, was so
in love with that Ewan one.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a more positive note, Jim Carrey gives an amazing performance. I also
enjoyed that of the ex-wife.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;It is one of those movies with a plot so complex that me got lost very
soon into it. It is also one of those movies that are so devoid of
excitement that it feels a bit like self-torture to watch to the end. It
didn&#x27;t help that the very uninteresting Gary Oldman is the lead
character, though it helped that there was a performance as fabulous as
that of Colin Firth.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;The suspense, which runs the entire length of the movie, is a bit hard
to bear. The movie also feels incomplete, some stuff left unexplained:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;why is the robot sinister&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;why does the robot help near the end&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what&#x27;s up with the old man&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;...&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The creature design of the humanoid creatures is incredible. The ending
is solid, and the famous alien, which is in baby form, is flawless.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Some of the imagery is beautiful, and so is the lead character. The
scene in the car with father and daughter is surprisingly good, and does
not fit the movie. That daughter is given the movie&#x27;s best performance.
The ends feels rushed... lazy writing. The demons are among some of the
worst creature designs ever in movies... there must have been a problem
with the budget.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;It was interesting to see a movie so big with action so intense set in
South Africa. Other than that fresh setting, there is nothing new at all
about the story.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is at least one inaccuracy... the train service shown is used
almost exclusively by the poorer among city people in that country of

review&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, among the few negative ones on the movie, very true. I find the
movie an uninteresting waste of time, and therefore it&#x27;s appeal is
mysterious to me. As mentioned in the review, there is a glaring lack of
explanation on the cruel situation some of the people find themselves
in. Not even the visual effects are really good, though I liked the
visual design of some of the sets.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

Fiennes a lot less menacing (and less interesting), and the movie itself
less exciting. The new character, the son of Poseidon, is interesting.
Andromeda, the queen of the human army, is given a miscast and
uninteresting performance by Rosamund Pike.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;The story of the Deathly Hallows makes for some of the best animation
I&#x27;ve seen yet, though it runs for only a few minutes. It&#x27;s a fresh
departure from an otherwise dull and overlong experience. The movie is
even a worse experience than &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;harry-potter-and-the-half-blood-prince-2009&quot;&gt;the immediate predecessor&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Though bearable, this is the worst so far in the series. Too much of it
feels like filler material (the romance and ensuing jealousy for
example), and it feels like we were denied a proper climax... it feels
incomplete. Even the visual effects are lesser, both in number and
merit, from (at least) the previous two movies. One thing that deserves
praise though is the smoke&#x2F;ink effect that was used whenever the
villains (dis)appear. It was also used to great effect in the
end-credits.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;This one is no improvement on &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;harry-potter-and-the-prisoner-of-azkaban-2004&quot;&gt;the one immediately predeceding it&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; but
is darker still, perhaps with even greater effects, though not as
numerous. The creature design of the baby-sized arch-villain deserves
respect, though it&#x27;s nothing new. The scenes in which it appears makes
for a darker movie than the previous ones.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The careless passiveness of the movie is quite annoying. One glaring
example is that Harry Potter&#x27;s troubles with the dragon are given all
the attention, while those of his competitors are totally ignored.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One performance that I enjoyed a lot, a new character, is the super-tall
lady.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;The battle between arch-villain and Dumbledore is the best action piece
so far in this series. It&#x27;s quite intense and has wonderful visual
effects. There are other good visual effect moments here and there. Even
the &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Dementors&quot;&gt;Dementors&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, which I so admired in the &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;harry-potter-and-the-prisoner-of-azkaban-2004&quot;&gt;3rd movie&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, have been given
a facelift, though I prefer the original look.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I remember enjoying the movie a lot more first time, most especially
&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Katherine_Heigl&quot;&gt;Katherine Heigl&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. It is still enjoyable, but that Katherine, though
desirable, is just so irritating.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What else I felt last time I watched:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The writers had no clue where to run with the story; I got surprised
when it ended, because the attacks were simply unjustified, and there
was no resolve.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Not as enchanting as &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;harry-potter-and-the-sorcerer-s-stone-2001&quot;&gt;the first one&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; but scarier with far bigger
effects, though none is spectacular, much of which is clumsy: the
spiders, the snake, and the angry tree. More tiring than the first since
it&#x27;s more of the same thing. The new ugly slave-like character is
unbearably irritating. It is similar to the Smeagol&#x2F;Gollum character in
the Lord of the Rings trilogy, only a lot less interesting.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one character I enjoyed much is that of the owner of the flying car.
Check especially the moment he accidentally celebrates the tale of the
boys&#x27; adventures in the flying car. My previous favorite character from
the first movie does not compare, and is a lot less interesting this
time around.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/harry-potter-and-the-prisoner-of-azkaban-2004/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;This one looks a lot better than the previous two (visual effects,
cinematography, production design). It also got superbly-realised
characters in the form the ghost-like creatures, the &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Dementors&quot;&gt;Dementors&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. This,
and a few others, were interesting concepts, but given the movie (book)
is targeted for children, the exploration is not satisfactory enough,
and the humor silly, perhaps to help make things less scary. I also
found the more grown-up children more interesting, most especially the
clever girl, one of the 3 best friends.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of time travel is given quality treatment, though it remains
silly, as is usual with time travel stories.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the best in the series.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Great martial arts choreography, some of the best I have seen; two
gorgeous guys, one the arrogant rural martial arts expert, and another,
the Janasese military leader, who is among the prettiest guys I&#x27;ve seen
ever.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is nothing really new here, and the lead actor could be more
interesting. Sadly, each of these oriental martial arts actors have Jet
Li to match against, and that&#x27;s a high standard of appeal. I am still
giving this one high marks because I seriously enjoyed it, me being a
sucker for its brand of formula.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Two things I enjoyed most:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the performance of the guy playing step-father of Harry Potter; it
was however a recycled caricature&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the chess game, which had great character design and animation;
it&#x27;s a pity it was mixed with substandard editing, with shots
repeatedly cutting to the kids; also, the kids didn&#x27;t fit well in a
sequence so scary&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most anything else is just standard, which is the sort of thing that
made it mysterious to me why the book&#x2F;movie series has had such
spectacular success.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;The one thing fresh about this movie is the loving portrayal of an
elderly gay man, which is something I don&#x27;t remember seeing before. The
direction is also pretty competent, and so is the acting. Pity it&#x27;s
being boring, and it&#x27;s slight bizarredness (e.g. talking dog) help make
it real unbearable.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;This one is special for being the first movie I saw poking fun at the
9&#x2F;11 disaster, where the plane crashing onto the skyscraper is portrayed
as an accident. The rest of it is seriously unconventional, some good,
too much of it uninteresting, and the whole thing pointless.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Ben Stiller gives &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;favorite-of-career-performances&quot;&gt;the most interesting performance of his career&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and
perhaps the only one I ever enjoyed. Sadly, he gives the only
interesting performance in the movie. Luckily, the movie makes up for
this with various hilarious moments, one favorite being the
playing-with-fire scene.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s a strange one because it feels so pointless by the end of it,
unless it&#x27;s just another anti-prison movie, in which case it&#x27;s pretty
much effective... the brutality is incredible. It&#x27;s also the first
time I&#x27;ve ever seen Harrold Perrineau play villain, and he is not so
convincing. The movie itself is very well-made, and the acting decent.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Given that this is a second rate actioner that isn&#x27;t overall decent, I
was not going to write a review about it, except that I actually found
the twist quite unique. I am temped to say &lt;em&gt;surprising&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, but that&#x27;s
what twists are supposed to be. But this one is especially so.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effort to make the professional assassin interesting worked pretty
well, considering it could have been a lot more cheesier&#x2F;cheaper. The
girlfriend of that assassin is extra-lovely too, and gives a decent
performance.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Julianne Moore and Annette Bening give incredible performances in
superbly-directed movie where they play lesbian mothers whose lives are
to be challenged by a stranger... sperm donor of their kids, also
played well by Mark Ruffalo. The issue is that he&#x27;s made so kool that
he&#x27;s not believable, and the contention he presents feels forced. It&#x27;s
an excellent premise, and interesttingly one that I haven&#x27;t seen
explored before, but the makers just didn&#x27;t know where to take the
story. I also don&#x27;t know what the point of it all is and it leaves a
few questions open.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed this a lot due to the delicious humor, best of which was the
out-of-control chair... absolutely hilarious. It was all nice, until
they had to do the stupid thing of bringing someone from the dead.
Instead of parodying the silly idea, they just fall prey to it. The end
is also lazy, and as uninteresting as the villain. Johnny&#x27;s sidekick is
a strange choice for a movie character, while Rosamund Pike seems a
goddess. How could anyone look like that! WTF!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;A very different comedy with a very unlikely lead; I loved the
performance of the extremist Muslim leader, especially when in the house

                <description>&lt;p&gt;The direction is shitty and the performances unbearably-irritating, most
especially the mentally-challended leading character (by Vivien Leigh).
As if that&#x27;s not enough, there&#x27;s also a horrible asshole played by
Marlon Brando. The only believable character is that of the lady
upstairs, though she isn&#x27;t given much screen time.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is among the most irritatingly-unbearable movies I&#x27;ve yet seen.
How the movie, and its performances, got so much praise is hard to
fathom. What the fuck!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

desirability charts, while the music her character does sucks hard. The
movie feels fresh (it&#x27;s not your typical pro-family fare), but not the
&amp;quot;family about to break apart&amp;quot; moment near the end, which is just too
common. Worse is that it&#x27;s annoying and feels contrived (and a better
actor should have been in the place of the government lady). The
attitude the older girl shows is also just too common, but it&#x27;s a
decent performance.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;There&#x27;s too much of an attempt at doing kool, much like &lt;em&gt;Lucky Number
Slevin&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; (which was made some years later), only with a lower budget and
less flash (production design, cinematography). It&#x27;s however a lot more
satisfying. I loved John Carrol Lynch&#x27;s performance. Morris Chestnut, a
not-so-competent actor, is miscast, and so is Dustin Hoffman, who
appears to be trying too hard.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed the natural-looking performance of Tshepang Mohlomi, who plays
the leader of a gang of street kids. Also, his character is given some
depth: he appears an asshole on the sufrace, but is actually a nice guy
who, for example, allows his ass to get ripped apart, only to share the
rewards with the rest of the gang.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The display of chilhood innocence (and naivéty) is done well, but sadly
none of the grown-ups are given any attention, all but the sister of the
dead mother, who gives the movie&#x27;s best performance.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The best thing in the movie is the tribal humanoid creatures; they
are given solid and believable personalities, as if they actually
exist. The best work is the leading lady, who also happens to be
damn fucking&#x27; desirable. I also loved the female spiritual leader
(she got presence).&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The entire experience of those humanoids riding flying creatures is
pure movie magic. The creatures they ride are quite impressive
(check for example when our hero is to tame one for the first time).&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The concept of Avatars is quite unique and fresh... it would be
interesting to experience another body.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;bad&quot;&gt;bad&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The human characters were not given quality treatment, all but the
lead (the image of him and his wheelchair is iconic). Most
unconvincing is the scarred military leader, followed by the
corporate representative (Giovanni Ribisi).&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The general feel of the alien world feels too artificial (there&#x27;s
too many bright-colored plants and animals). The creature design is
not satisfactory.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The helicopter driver lady should have been excluded. She is just
not an interesting actor, and cheapens the movie further.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;One commenter &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com&#x2F;2009&#x2F;12&#x2F;22&#x2F;opening-pandoras-box-the-arguments-over-avatar&#x2F;#comment5&quot;&gt;correctly noted&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; stylistic similarities to the
much-deplored Jar Jar Binks of Star Wars fame.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also enjoyed a &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.huffingtonpost.com&#x2F;ray-kurzweil&#x2F;reflections-on-iavatari_b_500226.html&quot;&gt;disapproving review&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; by a famous inventor and

                <description>&lt;p&gt;It is sad that this turned out a lot less impressive on a revisit,
though it remains better than any of the Batman movies before it. The
lead actor is not interesting; the mini-villain, the old man running the
underworld, is a bit interesting, though a bit too self-conscious, and
therefore not believable.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s a recycled story of a guy who appears to be a loser, but happens
to be quite useful when put in some specific situation. I appreciate it
because, regardless of being formulaic and shallow, it feels fresh --
it has unusual, laid-back direction, and quality comic performances from
the lead and, most especially, the master butler. It screws up with
it&#x27;s needless use of slapstick.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I expected a far more hard-hitting story, considering this is a modern
and high-end political drama. What I got was not interesting enough to
deserve going straight to cinema. It feels unfinished. Any random
episode of &lt;em&gt;The West Wing&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is superior.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gal is very wantable though, and the wife of the presidential
candidate (played by George Clooney) gives a decent performance, but is
denied screen appearance.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/robot-2010/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Though incredibly shallow, formulaic, and ludicrous, it is entertaining
at times. Also the beauty of the leading lady is without flaw and her
dance moves wonderful (there&#x27;s stupid full-length music sequences a few
times in the movie), and sex appeal nearly absent (though I would not
refuse an invitation).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anger the creator shows towards the robot is annoying (both given
unsatisfying performances), and is most unbearable at the moment when he
gets to break it apart. It&#x27;s too common &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;unforgiving-characters-are-annoying&quot;&gt;a flaw in Hollywood movies&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
and it&#x27;s sad to see it in a movie from a different market. The anger is
totally unjustfified because the robot has that time done various good
deeds, including saving a girl from being raped, saving a number of
people from fire, as well as helping a woman in difficult labour. All
that is conveniently forgotten... it&#x27;s just unberarable.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;It is rather too common in passive movies where you would find a bunch
of characters whose quality of life is improved by a protagonist, but
when something goes wrong as a result of the work of that protagonist,
they get to be unforgiving&#x2F;ungrateful to a point of public scorn or
physical violence. What makes this overly-common thing even more sad is
that such moments tend to spoil some decent quality movies.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some examples:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <pubDate>Mon, 02 Jul 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/it-s-a-wonderful-life-1946/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s sprinkled with some fun moments and interesting performances, but
I cannot forgive some of its shallow writing, especially the fantasy
moments near the end.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#x27;s one especially gorgeous woman (the wife), and one especially
desirable one (the seductive near-lover). The lead has his moments,
though his character&#x27;s self-importance is often annoying, though it was
probably interesting to audiences of the time.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite performace is by the lady playing Miss &amp;quot;Could I have
1750?&amp;quot; Davis, though it&#x27;s a very small role, lasting just a few
seconds. That performance also feels out of place in the movie of this
age... it feels a lot more modern.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ebb.org&#x2F;bkuhn&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2008&#x2F;12&#x2F;24&#x2F;capra-free-software.html&quot;&gt;A review that inspired me to watch this movie&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;The female leads, the mother (Tilda Swinton) and the daughter, are given
amazing, flawless performances. That mother is also given superb
character development, and so is the son, whose unenchanted mood and the
painful events he sees around his family fit very well with the ugly
camerawork and shit weather. The captivating subject matter (the
seldom-covered one of incest) keeps the movie edgy, even though the
dialog and the pace are kept to a minimum. The direction style makes the
whole thing feel realistic, and the focus on the boy made it feel like
you really are in his shoes, while the complexity of his character (he
was neither hero nor villain) made the movie all the more better.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found it sad that the two female characters outside the family were
thrown away without explanation, though they too were given good
performances.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I didn&#x27;t see any improvement in visual effects over &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;transformers-revenge-of-the-fallen-2009&quot;&gt;the previous
movie&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. The story is shit too, but the gal excessively gorgeous, much
more so than the previous overrated Megan Fox. Beyond money-making,
there can&#x27;t have been a reason this movie was made, especially since it
doesn&#x27;t add anything. The action is as frantic and hard-to-follow as in
the predecessors, with an annoying tendency of having the humans tougher
than would be realisitc (check how much they&#x27;re thrown around, only to
stand and continue fighting). Very little of the humor is effective, my
favorite being the part where the lead assaults own car.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/missing-1982/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;The wife character, played by Sissy Spacek, is not only
superbly-developed, but also desirable as fuck. Not only that, but it&#x27;s
a wonderful performance. The father character is however given the
movie&#x27;s best character development, as well as its best performance.
One other great performance is that of the bubbly guy from the US
military.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The director offers an exhilarating and well-written investigative
thriller, much like his earlier &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;z-1969&quot;&gt;Z (1969)&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, a more intense work, though
lesser overall. The subject matter is grim and the imagery horrific. The
filmstock is of shitty quality sadly, perhaps a deliberate decision, to
help make viewers feel unease.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;It is showing its age (camerawork, direction, visual effects), but still
got its charms. Check for example the husband and wife team who head the
family in question, even though the female side appears underused.
Christina Ricci is also wonderful as the daughter, and I also liked the
&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lurch_(The_Addams_Family)&quot;&gt;Frankenstein-like family butler&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. These are the only interesting
characters, and all others are either uninteresting, badly-developed,
annoying, or practically non-existent.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie is otherwise quite shallow and very passive, even for a
comedy. It&#x27;s not even funny, especially the first half of it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;The pretty brother of the gal who gets kidnapped for sex should have
been given less screen time. Either that or more acting classes. Same
applies to his sister, the victim, though to a greater extent. I wonder
if Kevin Kline took the role because his career isn&#x27;t doing so good, or
because of the subject matter (one would hope for the latter). I wonder
what&#x27;s up with the guy driving the victims to their fates. He
represents a failed attempt at a portrayal of a bad guy with some good
inside of him, but is given a real poor performance. In conclusion, I
really think the director is bad, and should not have been allowed to
head a movie that carries such an important message.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Weirdly humorous, especially given the serious subject matter of a
police-controlled plot to assassinate a politician who stirs things up.
It&#x27;s pretty unique, and very well-directed, and the relentlessness of
the guy in charge of investigating the whole thing admirable.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

Gyllenhaal, gives a real nice performance. Check especially the moment
when he&#x27;s told an uncomfortable fact. The villain is amazing too, and a
very unusual choice. The guy running the Source Code program is given an
embarassing and unconvincing performance.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;A top-notch thriller, complete with enthralling and fast-paced action
and a solid cast, led by a very credible Liam Neeson. The intensity
matches that of any movie in the trend-setting &lt;em&gt;Bourne&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; trilogy, though
with an evidently lower budget, and therefore less gloss, which is
pretty much welcome since found those movies rather wasteful, most
visibly in their chase sequences. In this one movie, there are two
chases sequences, and I feel the first one should have been cut
short... it wasn&#x27;t very interesting, and the movie feels too good to
be yet-another noisy actioner.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed the movie has received much negative criticism, which I
found very strange, especially given the skill the material was handled
with. Much of the complaints had to do with it having implausible plot
points, and I guess that I enjoyed it so much that I either didn&#x27;t
notice them, or that such weaknesses were really insignificant.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found the subject material (forced sex slavery) quite scary and
expertly handled.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is some appeal to the lead performer, but he&#x27;s mostly just
annoying. None of the other performances are particularly good, except
of course &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;John_Gielgud&quot;&gt;the guy playing the caregiver&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, who never fucks up anyways.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;The pacing is unbearably slow and the story is not interesting. Luckily,
some of the sci-fi elements are done well, e.g. the material the softens
landing impact is an interesting concept. The designs of suits and other
things, like the aircraft and the city are decent. The only interesting
character is Doctor Sid (voiced by Donald Sutherland). I suspect more
effort (and love) was put into him than anyone else, since he&#x27;s the
most detailed (this is 3D animation) and convincing, while also very
interesting.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I was a lot more impressed the first time I saw this:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complexity and technical sophistication of the fight sequences are
what &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; trilogy only dreamed of. It&#x27;s the best piece of
action I&#x27;ve seen so far.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a revisit, I feel like that first statement is an exagerration,
even though the action really is good. Problem is that it&#x27;s just too
frantic, such that it&#x27;s hard to notice what the fuck is going on. With
that in mind, the second statement is no longer true.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found the movie unbearable, and I find it strange that I managed first
time around. I found all the talk of life force or somesuch silly, I
found the characters uninteresting, I found the obsession with
children&#x27;s innocence overdone, I found the obsession with beautiful
boys and girls needless, I found the character design (worst of which
was the monster flying creature) to be of intensely bad taste, I found
the choice of lighting shitty, I found the (seeming) requirement to have
familiarity with the games the movie is based in order to appreciate the
(complex) backstory stupid, ...&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/appleseed-ex-machina-2007/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;The lead character from &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;appleseed-2004&quot;&gt;the first movie&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; takes a backseat somewhat,
making way for the cyborg friend and former lover, and to a lesser
extent, the lover&#x27;s clone, as well as to multiple other key characters.
It&#x27;s an interesting concept actually, and I haven&#x27;t seen it explored
before: that the clone looks and acts so much like the former lover
presents a challenge, and the conflict is apparent, but not overdone.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The director, who also directed the first movie, has worsened his
obsession with beautiful people. There&#x27;s a lot more of them here,
although I did really like a senior representative of some weapons
manufacturing company named Poseidon. She&#x27;s presented with greater
admiration than the lead.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The action does not offer any real improvement over the previous movie,
even though the budget is 3 times as large. It&#x27;s also not as
interesting. The animation is of more consistent quality than the first
movie, but there&#x27;s nothing really groundbreaking.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sidenote&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: Why the fuck did they have to drastically change the
physical look of Athena (basically the president of the city) so much?
She&#x27;s not even recognizable.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <pubDate>Mon, 28 May 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
                <link>http://tshepang.net/appleseed-2004/</link>
                <guid>http://tshepang.net/appleseed-2004/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;In animation, I don&#x27;t remember seeing a face of a female character as
beautifully shot as the lead character here. We also get to have
multiple such moments (she really is gorgeous!), which makes me suspect
the director must have oogled over her. The one problem though is that
she doesn&#x27;t exactly look the part of a supremely skilled warrior. Her
great strength is also left unexplained.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 2 more characters that could have been better:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hitomi, the leader of the rescue mission that helped the lead; she
sucks because she was chosen merely for some Japanese idea of sex
appeal, the sort so common in erotic Japanese soft porn stuff;
that&#x27;s no problem, except her character doesn&#x27;t fit the role, and
in a more severe manner than the lead herself.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dr. Gilliam Knute, the genius creator of a species similar to
humans, is also designed purely for sex appeal (she is pretty too).
She really isn&#x27;t my idea of the character she&#x27;s forced into. Also,
the moments involving her aren&#x27;t done very well, a lame attempt to
give the movie emotional punch.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the visual design is quite nice, but is inconsistently so. The
fusion of 2D and 3D is a bit poor, but some of the movements of the
characters (e.g. some movements like walking, or fighting) are quite
impressive. As for the designs of the exo-skeleton, did they have to
look so bulky? Anyways, the catwoman-like robots are wonderful to look
at, complete with their metal-cutting whips. This is one case where sex
appeal worked well.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <title>The Bang-Bang Club (2010)</title>
                <pubDate>Thu, 24 May 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
                <link>http://tshepang.net/the-bang-bang-club-2010/</link>
                <guid>http://tshepang.net/the-bang-bang-club-2010/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Comments on articles tend to be bad, and if you are lucky, just decent.
They are seldom outstanding though, as seen of &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theglobeandmail.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;arts&#x2F;movies&#x2F;the-bang-bang-club-fizzles-with-compromises&#x2F;article2011622&#x2F;comments&#x2F;&quot;&gt;these ones&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; which are
critical of the article they respond to. Basically what&#x27;s happening is
that the critic does offer a decent review, summarizing the story
nicely, but then resorts to unjustified criticism. That is sad,
especially because I found the movie quite good. Read them (the
comments), for they are better reviews than mine.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am still going to given mine of course, by mentioning two main things
I really appreciate about the movie:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The portrayal South Africa (my home) is quite authentic. There was
good research effort involved, to the point of even using the
now-obsolete cash. The behavior and the utterances of Black people
wasn&#x27;t screwed up either (as it so often happens when foreigners
set a movie here). The one complaint I have is that the white guys
aren&#x27;t convincing as South Africans, and there doesn&#x27;t seem to be
any real effort to mimic local accents. I even thought that the real
life Club members were foreigners.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was amazed by the performance of one local actor, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.co.za&#x2F;search?q=patrick+shai&quot;&gt;Patrick Shai&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.
I&#x27;ve never given kudos to the guy, though he never got a heck of a
lot of chances to strut his stuff (the local movie industry is
nearly non-existent), but he really shined here, and gives the
movie&#x27;s best performance. I also find his character to be the
movie&#x27;s most interesting because, regardless of him being among the
leaders of a small group of tribal killers, he also happens to have
a soft side... literally a savior of one heroic guy. Watching him
was a serious relief since I was concerned that these guys would be
some sort of faceless aggressors&#x2F;victims. Sure about all of them
were, but at least there was him, and one other guy saddened by the
death of wife and child.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an important movie, and it&#x27;s sad that it hasn&#x27;t achieved the
popularity it deserves. I&#x27;m still not going to claim it&#x27;s a
masterpiece because, other than that performance, I&#x27;m not sure I wanna
give it a repeat viewing. It&#x27;s not because it&#x27;s unpleasant. It just
feels that what kept me glued were moments that won&#x27;t be so thrilling
second time around. I don&#x27;t know, I&#x27;ll see.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;nit-picks&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That scene depicting &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;iconicphotos.wordpress.com&#x2F;2009&#x2F;08&#x2F;12&#x2F;vulture-stalking-a-child&#x2F;&quot;&gt;vulture and child in hungry Sudan&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; should not
have been attempted, or at least removed from the movie. It adds
nothing to the movie, and too iconic a moment of history to be given
such a lame attempt. For one, the child in the movie didn&#x27;t look as
bony.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was left hungry for further exploration of the political climate
of South Africa, beyond the unconvincing angry Black guy criticizing
the White guys from profiting from taking photos of those in pain.
In fact I think it&#x27;s this sort of thing that makes the
&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theglobeandmail.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;arts&#x2F;movies&#x2F;the-bang-bang-club-fizzles-with-compromises&#x2F;article2011622&#x2F;&quot;&gt;&#x27;unjustified&#x27; criticism&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; I mentioned above make some sense. Such
things tend to only dawn on me some time after the movie has ended.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;A large part of this romantic comedy is quite enjoyable, and helped much
by the delightful and rather fresh performance by the lead, &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Russell_Brand&quot;&gt;Russell
Brand&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. He also gave me &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;2011-movie-review&quot;&gt;one of 2011&#x27;s best performances&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;get-him-to-the-greek-2010&quot;&gt;Get Him to
the Greek&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;), so it was great watching him offering similar acting style.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest happens to be &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-unbearable-hollywood-romantic-comedy-formula&quot;&gt;the formula that too many Hollywood romantic
comedies tend to adopt&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and it&#x27;s so fucking annoying. Nick Nolte&#x27;s
character was neither interesting nor portrayed well. In fact, he&#x27;s
embarassing. The lead girl is fucking desirable, but her character was
made annoyingly uptight, since it had to fit in with that formula I
mentioned.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;There is no shortage of hilarious moments, though none is as great as
the pregnancy one; Jamie Foxx does a nice bit performance; the character
of Kevin Spacey is rather overdone.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie is fun, but it sadly has a sketchy, amateurish feel of &lt;em&gt;The
40-Year-Old Virgin&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Office Space&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, both of which were also fun. It
just feels like a collection of antics, instead of one solid whole
worthy of being called a movie.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <title>Gladiator (2000)</title>
                <pubDate>Sun, 20 May 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
                <link>http://tshepang.net/gladiator-2000/</link>
                <guid>http://tshepang.net/gladiator-2000/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;This time around, I enjoyed this over-rated movie more than previously,
where I noted thusly:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretentious and uninspiring; lacks the epic punch you&#x27;d get from a
Ben-Hur, despite being armed with more modern visuals.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is still the case of course: there&#x27;s just nothing new. Luckily it
doesn&#x27;t bore and has some edge-of-the-seat moments. But there&#x27;s also a
bad performance from Djimon Hounsou, and none of the rest are actually
impressive&#x2F;convincing. There is also a lame attempt to eclipse a
&lt;em&gt;Braveheart&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, which must have provided some inspiration, beyond &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Gladiator_(2000_film)#Influences&quot;&gt;the
ones mentioned on the movie&#x27;s Wikipedia page&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opening scene, which is meant to build suspense for the impending
battle, as well as show the kind of respect given the lead character, is
very well-made. The movie&#x27;s second-best moment is the quick turn of
events following the king&#x27;s death. It&#x27;s a very interesting portrayal
of how fast a respected person can fall, given a powerful-enough
opponent.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Oscars are embarassing to have honored the movie with Best Picture
Oscar. They deserve to be ignored, for there surely must have been
numerous superior movies that year.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/j-edgar-2011/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;The production design is top-class (impeccable set design and props),
while the old-age make-up is embarassingly bad. Even the 2 actors
playing the aging characters are unbearable to watch, perhaps as
unbearable as the immensely unpleasant title character. The
movie itself starts okay, but starts to be really boring and pointless.
I was surprised that it was made by the great Clint Eastwood. It must be
his worst.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I praised the costume and production design when the movie began, but
not later on. I either stopped caring, or the excellence wasn&#x27;t
sustained somehow, I just don&#x27;t know. I was also impressed by the 2
ladies who portrayed Queen Elizabeth I. The conspiracy story wasn&#x27;t so
riveting since I&#x27;ve heard it before (and I don&#x27;t care much since I
think Shakespeare is overrated, either that or I&#x27;m not smart&#x2F;cultured
enough to enjoy his work). The movie is however very well-made, and non
of it bores at all, even though it loses steam part-way through.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <pubDate>Sat, 19 May 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/the-hangover-part-ii-2011/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;I didn&#x27;t expect much from this since it was trashed by critics, but
found it quite entertaining, and filled with interesting characters. My
favorite is the character played by &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ken_Jeong&quot;&gt;Ken Jeong&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, a fun-loving criminal
with feminine mannerisms. One other great thing about the movie is the
setting, which portrays Bang Kok is some gritty, seedy city, where crime
is rampant and the police under-resourced. It feels authentic, whether
or not it&#x27;s based on reality. It&#x27;s a showcase of good production
design.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having watched the previous (and lesser) movie also makes one appreciate
this one more, even though the formula is the same.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;A very grim portrayal of a witch hunt motivated by an epidemic in some
ancient European area. It&#x27;s well-made and well-acted, and the battles
are more convincing than the more expensive movies set in its time, and
violence more brutal. There&#x27;s not one light-hearted moment, no comic
sidekick, just a whole lot of shit life. Lucky me being born here and
now.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Despite my dislike of the subject (animal abuse for the sake of
entertainment and profit), I was curious enough to watch the whole
thing. It&#x27;s competently-made and got some decent performances, but it
is merely yet-another sports movie, only this time involving animals.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Much like the first experience I had with &lt;em&gt;Underground&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, I found this
unbearably irritating. This is due to the bizarre storyline and
directing, as well as an eccentric&#x2F;insane lead character.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The desirable gals, especially the main love interest (played by
Charlotte Gainsbourg), makes it survivable. The romantic drama involving
her almost makes the movie worthwhile, and her performance is
amazing&#x2F;flawless. The gal playing the friend is a lot prettier though,
while the one playing the colleague isn&#x27;t bad either.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/the-iron-lady-2011/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;A wonderful cast:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meryl Streep is good as usual in the lead role, though I wasn&#x27;t
entirely satisfied with her portrayal of modern-day (frail) Margaret
Thatcher.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The lady playing the young Margaret, Alexandra Roach, is amazing,
and her performance the movie&#x27;s most interesting. I&#x27;m even tempted
to call it the movie&#x27;s best, but am held back from that opinion
given that it&#x27;s pretty much carecatured.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The guy playing the modern day husband, Margaret&#x27;s hallucination of
a dead man, Jim Broadbent, offers nice and laid-back humor.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The direction is sophisticated and smooth, though there&#x27;s too much
focus on the modern-day Margaret, with so many flashbacks that it&#x27;s
just distracting. I also left the movie feeling like I still don&#x27;t know
enough about this 20th century giant. Perhaps the treatment was a little
too humorous, and too soft, especially considering the great importance
of the issues involved in Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s reign as prime minister.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;If found the largest part of the movie unbearably bad, and the very
uninteresting performances of the two leads didn&#x27;t help. The movie
attempts to be a great romance, but there&#x27;s nothing fresh nor is there
anything really interesting. Also, it&#x27;s mostly a period movie, but none
of the costumes impress, and the production design is even worse,
reminiscent of made-for-tv stuff.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <title>Battleship (2012)</title>
                <pubDate>Fri, 04 May 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
                <link>http://tshepang.net/battleship-2012/</link>
                <guid>http://tshepang.net/battleship-2012/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Real nice visual effects, some of the best I&#x27;ve seen yet:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the wheel-of-destruction and the destruction it wields make for some
of the most impressive character designs ever; the design isn&#x27;t so
fresh... it&#x27;s inspired by some similar machinery in one of the
&lt;em&gt;Transformers&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; movies&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it&#x27;s not groundbreaking, but the facial rendering of the aliens is
amazing; it&#x27;s not at the level of a Davey Jones or a Kong though&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie isn&#x27;t as big and loud as the &lt;em&gt;Transformers&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; movie series, but
the concept is a lot less silly, and the story a lot less annoying.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most surprising thing about the movie is the appearance of the
leg-less guy, some ugly big guy who gives a wonderful performance, the
most interesting in the movie. It&#x27;s surprising because I&#x27;ve never seen
the guy before, and that a crippled character would be given such a key
role. Sure there was &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;dr-strangelove-1964&quot;&gt;Dr. Strangelove&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, but that was a comedy.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was sad when the movie ended, both because it was too short, and
because there was no explanation on what the aliens wanted. What made
this even sadder is fact that they appeared not wholly evil, making them
more interesting. I even thought that, later in the movie, there would
be something like &lt;em&gt;stop fighting us; we come in peace&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <pubDate>Sun, 29 Apr 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
                <link>http://tshepang.net/persona-1966/</link>
                <guid>http://tshepang.net/persona-1966/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Another example of &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-case-of-the-matrix-reloaded&quot;&gt;The Case of &#x27;The Matrix Reloaded&#x27;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, this is how I
felt after the first viewing:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... happens to possess much sophistication (direction and dialogue)
with some shocking imagery, including one which must have inspired
&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;fight-club-1999&quot;&gt;Fight Club&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (a sort of obscenity which is surprising for a 60&#x27;s
movie). The movie also feels fresh, feeling like a modern
psychological drama&#x2F;thriller, and therefore not as tiring and awkward
as those of its age, perhaps testimony of its director, Ingmar
Bergman, who is among the most honored ever.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watching it again, it&#x27;s so strange that it feels like a different movie
altogether. I struggled to stay awake... it&#x27;s boring as fuck. It&#x27;s
also pointless. I must go find out what the fuss is all about.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;So someone spent close to $100m on this, and then classified it as
ready for release! One of the mysteries of movie-making. It is mildly
entertaining, but the visual effects are so bad (was it this bad in the
mid-90s?), the storyline so lacking, and characters so thin. I did
however like 2 character designs:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the oversized (and scary) robot&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they guy with a metal head&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a far better take on the title character, see &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;dredd-2012&quot;&gt;Dredd&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/remember-me-2010/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;It starts in a very promising way, with a well-directed
robbery-and-murder scene, complete with great camerawork, pacing, and
acting. Sadly, the movie soon turns into some soppy, uninteresting
romance, with two uninteresting lovers, whose characters appear to
desperately feel interesting. Luckily we get good performances from
Chris Cooper (as always) and Pierce Brosnan, both playing the respective
fathers.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire exercise feels pointless though, and the Sep 11 reference
needless. What the fuck is up with that?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Heavily-overrated with not a single performance worthy of high praise.
Fairly-enjoyable, but my great lack of interest in the mafia doesn&#x27;t
help. It&#x27;s not hard-hitting enough (think &lt;em&gt;American Gangster&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, which
itself however has the advantage of being younger), and the direction
not satisfactory, which is very strange considering it&#x27;s done by Martin
Scorcese, the same guy who brought us both &lt;em&gt;Taxi Driver&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Raging

&lt;li&gt;the mother expressing her greatfulness&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the two great compliments the mother gets&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#x27;s funny moments:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the emitted sound when answering the phone&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;some of unusual behavior the author portrays&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie also boasts some unusual dialog, and an unusual (and
irritating) character played by Cuba Gooding, jnr.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <title>Perfume (2006)</title>
                <pubDate>Sat, 21 Apr 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
                <link>http://tshepang.net/perfume-2006/</link>
                <guid>http://tshepang.net/perfume-2006/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;The impression from the first viewing:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disgusting scenery and painful story found in this one-of-a-kind
movie reminds me of &lt;em&gt;Delicatessen&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, only amplified, and treated with
far superior skill, and a more engaging storyline. The sort of emotion
this sort of movie instilled in me is quite rare, and has similar
intensity to what is found in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;apocalypto-2006&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apocalypto&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. The costume design is
perhaps even better than what can be seen in the (lesser) &lt;em&gt;Pirates of
the Caribbean&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; trilogy.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The impression from a revisit:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Perfume&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; remains magnificent but got a few warts (sleep-inducing,
disorganised and overlong storyline, smallish events which don&#x27;t
serve the story, a very uninteresting Alan Rickman and an unconvincing
daughter) which can&#x27;t effectively be hidden by its strengths (an
original story, superb costume design and direction, superb lead
performer, great cast).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we all know, each repeat viewing of a movie is a different
experience, and in the case of this movie, each revisit proves I&#x27;ve
overrated the movie the previous time. In this case, for example, I
didn&#x27;t find the costumes that great, the lead performance so super, the
direction so laudable, nor the cast so great. Sure it remains way better
than your average movie, but the novelty just wears off.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

exploration into what would it be like to experience being another human
being. It also got wonderful performances:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;probably the only John Cusack performance I&#x27;ve enjoyed yet&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Catherine Keener is amazing, and so is the gorgeous Cameron Diaz&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John Malkovich rocks playing himself&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;my favorite is the movie&#x27;s funniest character, the employer John
Cusack&#x27;s loser; it&#x27;s pure pleasure watching his eccentricities&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie could do with better camerawork and visual effects, maybe even
set design, but one can almost ignore those shortcomings since it&#x27;s
well-written and directed.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Given that this was made by David Fincher, you know, the same guy who
made &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;fight-club-1999&quot;&gt;Fight Club&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;se7en-1995&quot;&gt;Se7en&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, it was way too underwhelming, too
average. The story, the acting, the direction, none outstanding. I get
the vibe that the work the movie is based on is quite famous, so maybe
this movie doesn&#x27;t do it justice. This is easily Fincher&#x27;s least
interesting, perhaps with the exclusion of his first, &lt;em&gt;Alien 3&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, I nearly forgot that the opening credits sequence was quite good.
That and the fact that I could not actually figure what was going on.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed the duels, especially the bloody one (the only such in the
movie). I enjoyed the music, singing, and rejoicing of the poor people
in the inn even more. The greatest moment in the movie, one thing that
brought tear to eye, is the act of kindness that the lead character
showed toward the unruly and disliked prostitute.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wife of the lead is a badly-developed character. The attempt to make
her angelic is nearly ludicrous, and the performer isn&#x27;t skilled enough
to help achieve the goal. Another bad character, though to a lesser
extent, is the political leader. His portrayal is too fierce to
convince.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, the movie is rather empty.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I don&#x27;t remember how I bumped into Jonathan Rosenbaum but he turned out
to be best ever movie critic I&#x27;ve read. The grandeur of his reviews,
obtained through extensive film viewing, sheer love for the art form,
and superior expressiveness, is enough to compel one into patting him as
the best, regardless the fact that I rarely ever agree with him. He
provides inspiration, and his contributions push film criticism as a
respectable practice.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/the-island-2005/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;There was some serious weaknesses with the plot (e.g. the clone of
Michael Clark Duncan was also a body builder, the two kids managed to
outsmart highly trained adults, why the clones had to be conscious was
merely brushed over). The action is too loud and frantic, as if the
makers were concerned that the excitement wasn&#x27;t enough. There&#x27;s also
way too much of it. The evilness of the guards wasn&#x27;t believable.
There&#x27;s also the very annoying thing of the lead villain turning action
guy near the end. So fucking silly.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this shit is more annoying because of my love for the freshness of
the material. Among the responsible is the 2 lead characters, played by
Ewan McGregor and the beloved Scarlett Johansson. More freshness comes
from each of the other clones. It&#x27;s fun seeing seemingly-grown people
be themselves (i.e. kids). Not so fresh, but Steve Buscemi provides some
nice humor. The brutality he later on faces is sadly left unexplained.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s a fairly interesting story of a rookie cop being driven around by
an experienced one, but it appears more a Denzel Washington &amp;quot;my acting
skillz rock&amp;quot; show than anything else. There is a visible attempt at
building something really good and exciting, but it&#x27;s somehow just
lacking. It&#x27;s intetesting enough to watch it to the end without it
feeling unbearable, but it just feels like it drags, telling a story
whose purpose appears non-existent.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They should also have chosen a more interesting actor than Ethan Hawke.
I enjoyed Macy Gray&#x27;s bit performance even though it was overdone. Dr.
Dre should have been excluded or taken more acting lessons.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Halle Barry does a similar character she played in &lt;em&gt;Monster&#x27;s Ball&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;,
only this time there appears a lot more close-up shots which exposes her
not-to-impressive acting talent (and overrated prettiness). The movie
itself feels a little pretentious, not least of which is the character
of Benicio Del Toro, who plays a guy suffering from drug addiction.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s about basketball, romantic relationships, and money, and it&#x27;s not
ambitious about it. It&#x27;s got some interesting performances here and
there, the best of which take place in the court. But it also got some
substandard ones, especially the lovers of the lead characters
especially. The direction is a little weird, and it appears the actors a
lot of freedom, and some scenes feel over-extended. Check especially an
early one, where the two leads meet for the first time.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Another comedy that relies heavily on goofiness for its laughs, and
pretty effective at that. It is in large part due to the
overly-competitive and pretentious rival teacher, played well by Lucy
Punch. Another good performance is by Justin Timberlake, playing an even
goofier yes-man. The lead performance by Cameron Diaz is extremely
uninteresting, but luckily her students are well-cast, and a very
non-standard cast at that.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly the movie is ridiculously shallow, and there is no battle to
fight, and nothing is resolved... I don&#x27;t know what the fuck it&#x27;s
about. It feels very incomplete. Even the quality cast is underused (I
wish I could see more of Timberlake, the fat teacher, the kids, and much
less of Cameron Diaz).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Offers some insight in medical science processes, but there is at least
one concept that was dumbed down too much (Why volume of specific
compound rises when intake of food containing it is reduced?). I&#x27;m sure
it was for the lay audience, but I don&#x27;t think the audience is that
stupid. Nick Nolte is annoying and unconvincing with the Italian accent
while Susan Sarandon&#x27;s character is annoying with her obsession and
selfishness. Their perseverance is admirable though, as well as their
efforts to help discover the treatment for the disease their son suffers
from.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The balanced view of the scientific community vs. the parents is handled
quite well, and isn&#x27;t as simplified as you&#x27;d come to expect in movies.
The scientists and those who respect them aren&#x27;t viewed with
incompetence (let&#x27;s ignore the dumbed-down part) or laziness, only with
the eye that they do have other priorities which are not necessarily
less urgent&#x2F;important than the one faced by the parents.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;A mildly entertaining drama about some FBI guys investigating some
race-related violent crimes, which gets tiring about halfway through.
None of the characters are really interesting, nor is the acting, except
that Frances McDormand is a bit lovely.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I was attracted to this because of the story of a guy who exposed police
corruption, but it turned out to be unbearably boring. Al Pacino gives a
decent performance, but it&#x27;s not enough.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;The main villain is annoying to watch and the gorgeous love prostitute
uninteresting. The lead character is interesting enough, and so is the
action. Some of the humor, none of which is actually funny, is taken a
bit too far (one guy kills another with a carrot).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I liked the camerawork but not the negative view the writers have on the
customers of sex workers. It&#x27;s too shallow, just like the movie, though
luckily it doesn&#x27;t pretend not to be.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Similar in style to the &lt;em&gt;Bourne&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; series, it also happens to be quite
entertaining, although three of the major characters are given bad
performances (the lead, the love interest, and the black guy in power).
The subject matter is of a fearsome concept of sniper work, except that,
as regards to the story, it&#x27;s not convincing how far the bad guys went
for the cash payoff.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Another case where white people are portrayed as both retarded and
cruel, with bad performers. The lead actor is fun to watch and the
leading is a pleasure to the eye. All characters are shallow as fuck but
the martial arts are decent, though often uninteresting and some fights
are too long. The hair thing is ludicrous.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed watching the faces made by the lead actor. Some funny shit.
Sadly, the movie&#x27;s only worthy moment is where her character dances
with old people. I love her daughter too, but that&#x27;s mere sexual
attraction (she&#x27;s totally wantable!?). Other than that, there&#x27;s some
minor things that entertain, but the rest of the movie is crap. I don&#x27;t
get what the point is. It&#x27;s too overdone to be funny, and if it&#x27;s
supposed to be satirical, it&#x27;s the worst I&#x27;ve seen. The movie would
have been far more effective if the sex-crazed people didn&#x27;t look so
idiotic. Fuck, some even have supernatural powers. Why didn&#x27;t the
makers of the movie do some decent visual effects?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;strong&gt;sidenote&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;] I get the vibe that the director is a lot more capable
that what he displays here, so maybe I&#x27;m missing the point.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Nicole Kidman is kick-ass and so is her acting +++ check the almost
unbearable intensity she portrays at some high-brow show (probably
opera) which she visits with her boyfriend. The script is damn amazing
too, and so is the camerawork, and this, a drama, is among the most
suspenseful movies I&#x27;ve ever seen.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A revisit rendered the movie a litle boring, but the performances and
great direction kept it interesting. The story also felt a lot more
silly. I can even understand why the movie was so heavily panned.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;The kid actor playing the lead&#x27;s son, Dakota Goyo, gives a real good
performance and his character is really interesting and unpredictable,
just the like the movie. The lady playing the lead&#x27;s love interest is
quite good too. The movie is strange, directed in an unusual manner,
such that I didn&#x27;t enjoy much of it, especially the first half. It
started being a little fun when I started seeing some action on stage,
but there wasn&#x27;t even enough of that.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The asshole levels of the lead character (played by Hugh Jackman in a
surprisingly decent performance) are hard to bear, when he is being an
ass. The redneck is given a memorable performance.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;The character of the king&#x27;s investigator, with humorous and laid-back
fighting style, is fun to watch, though not nearly as much as the
ultra-sweet sister of the king. The martial are rdiculously overdone (we
know this is fantasy, but there&#x27;s limits even there) and the visual
effects unsatisfactory. The long-awaited for duel is less than
impressive.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed the ovie a lot more first time I watched it, mainly impressed
by the romantic aspect of it, but I think it was heavily affected by my
love for that king&#x27;s sister. Check her massive eyes, and check her face
when sad, or when happy.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;This I watched merely for the sake of curiosity: the entire movie takes
place in a single room and has only two characters engaged in one long
conversation. They discuss a number of issues (god, suicide, jail, bad
deeds, friendship...). Samuel L. Jackson is as unsatisfying (and noisy)
as usual while Tommy Lee Jones should have done something more fitting
of his acting skills. It happens to be mainly noise about nothing, and
me wonders what the point is (life sucks?). Beware of some really bad
usage of sound effects.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;For almost it&#x27;s entire running length, it&#x27;s very fast-paced, a fact
that helps hide its incompetence, considering that there&#x27;s nothing new
or fresh, other than having the first young girl action hero I&#x27;ve seen
yet. Hers portrayal is not convincing, even when grown up. However,
there&#x27;s a good performance by the guy playing the lead FBI agent
(&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lennie_James&quot;&gt;Lennie James&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;), who recently impressed me in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-next-three-days-2010&quot;&gt;The Next Three Days&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.
The subplot involving the love interest was a waste of time, although it
was well-made, as is the movie in general.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;The romantic relationship between Jet Li&#x27;s lead character and that of
the lead villain (he didn&#x27;t suspect anything about his&#x2F;her
villainy&#x2F;sexuality) is both the most important and my favorite in the
movie. This lead character is surrounded by at least two other lovely
women (me want them), both of whom appear to have the hearts for him,
but he doesn&#x27;t once make a move on them.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s a very low budget movie, but the martial arts choreography is
impressive. The direction is a little unfocused, and the humor does get
in the way of that focus... the balance between comedy and drama isn&#x27;t
quite right, as is so common with old Jet Li movies.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Real nice opening credits visuals, some interesting martial arts, and a
weird thing where the main story ends way before the end of the movie.
It&#x27;s like the makers were honest enough to realise that they didn&#x27;t
have much material, and decided to start another subplot involving some
Russian fighters challenge our hero. As is usual with these martial arts
Chinese movies, the white foreigners receive some seriously shallow
character development, and happen to be unconvincingly evil.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lead character is done poorly by Vincent Zhao, the same guy who
spoiled &lt;em&gt;Once Upon A Time In China&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; series by replacing Jet Li in the
4th and 5th movies in the series. I don&#x27;t remember enjoying any of his
other performances.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;The first part of the movie is better than the latter, with the humorous
antics of the title character, and the excellence of his sidekick, not
least of which is the coffee-making. The lead villain is also fun to
watch, especially with his the constant (and humorous) concern of the
fearsomeness of his image&#x2F;presence. The split-screen moment, where
various bounty hunters are sent for the title character, is amazing, and
among the most innovative visuals I&#x27;ve seen in movies yet.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, the movie gets a little annoying when this title character stops
being funny (&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;unforgiving-characters-are-annoying&quot;&gt;and ungrateful&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;), starting with the moment he shoots the
sidekick. There is also unexplained physical prowess, the sort that
makes the movie feel like passive entertainment, and the destruction
that happens in the movie&#x27;s final action sequence is way too much. Why
the noise?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I watched this only because Woody Allen made it, and now I wish he was
the one playing the lead character, not a poor imitator. The fantasy
element of it is a bit interesting (no one in my experience has made
such a smooth and unassuming time travel movie) but there&#x27;s a feel of
self-importance about the whole thing and that&#x27;s annoying and makes it
unbearable. Maybe Woody is getting lazy and arrogant. I haven&#x27;t seen
all of his work, but this is likely his worst. The costumes are nice
though.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s hard to imagine the movie having as much impact had it been told
in a more conventional way (there entire thing is done on a small stage,
which doesn&#x27;t change throughout it&#x27;s entire 3-hour run, except at the
very end). It&#x27;s an effective experiment that proves that, with good
directorial skill, a movie experience can be satisfying with almost no
budget. I however expect that only serious movie buffs would watch the
entire thing.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first viewing of this was among the most impactful I&#x27;ve had of any
movie, to a point where I called a masterpiece. A revisit wasn&#x27;t so
kind though because of diminished impact. I still love the narrator&#x27;s
style of storytelling (told like a children&#x27;s fable). I found the
character of the philosopher quite annoying (and I&#x27;m sure that was the
intention), a character developed and performed similar to that of the
scientist in Battlestar Galactica tv series (the one made in the
2000&#x27;s). There is not one other character that is interesting, that is
if we ignore James Caan. The movie is also frustratingly long and I&#x27;m
curious why it was made (why portray such brutality), and even more
curious, why was the annoying philosopher character added.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s interesting to have a movie that is both spooky and enchanting.
There&#x27;s a bunch of strange characters, and everyone of them are
designed badly (what&#x27;s up with these Japanese animators?), but the
story keeps it all interesting. This is despite the clumsy 2D animation
and shallow character development. The lead character is admirable for
her kindheartedness, and it&#x27;s touching seeing characters surrounding
her with affection, one of which is a spoilt baby and another, a greedy
and lonely monster that swallows sentient beings (a human, a frog, and
some other creature I can&#x27;t identify).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <title>Requiem For A Dream (2000)</title>

                <description>&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s only truly masterful&#x2F;great movies which offer great experiences on
a revisit as on the first viewing. This, Darren Aronofosky&#x27;s disturbing
masterpiece, is one of them. The story is quite simple, focusing on 4
characters, and each having drug additions, and it&#x27;s about the horrid
results that follow. There is good humor here and there, and there is a
whole lot of good acting.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that I hardly pay attention to is movie scores, but the one in
here is among the most memorable, and it matches the movie quite well.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One tear-jecking moment is when the mommy character (played by &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ellen_Burstyn&quot;&gt;Ellen
BUrstyn&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;) expresses the high shitness levels of her life to son. Sadly
this mommy character is a little overdone (as if retarded), though her
acting is pretty good.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;

mine.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;There&#x27;s a number of enchanting moments, and Alice is sweet to the eye;
she is also lovely in battle costume and battle movement; the hatter is
at times fun (my favorite moment, also the saddest, is when exclaiming
how good it would be that he dies looking good); the evil queen is the
most interesting of all, despite the fact that her deeds are at times
too evil to swallow (e.g. her usage of an animal as a golf ball, or her
castle being surrounded by heads she severed). The movie however feels
rushed and the characters underdeveloped.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;A very delightful and shallow comedy about a guy who is to spend
millions within a month for an even bigger reward. Richard Pryor, the
lead, is fun to watch and so is the story, especially early on. The best
act in the movie is the lead&#x27;s political campaign. I can vaguely
remember it, so I consider among the funniest movies I&#x27;ve watched this
year.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;strong&gt;sidenote&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;] Richard Pryor style of comedy makes Chris Rock look
like a sorry imitator.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I once hailed this as a masterpiece, and though it remains excellent,
the emotional punch it carries has been reduced. The movie feels like
it&#x27;s cut short even though it&#x27;s nearly 2 hours long. I enjoyed the
story so much, with it&#x27;s multiple alternate-reality stories concept,
that I wanted more and more of it. It&#x27;s done quite well, but none of
the stories are given enough treatment, resulting in the movie feeling
too short.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 7-year old boy gives one of the best child performances I&#x27;ve seen
yet, but the movie&#x27;s best is that by the fat friend in college, while
my most favorite was the religious guy who sharing a cell with the lead
character. It was quite interesting to have the actors take different
roles in each alternate reality.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would have preferred superior camerawork, not the shitty tv-like one,
which was most evident in the very first scene.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sidenotes&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I found the &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Butterfly_Effect#Reception&quot;&gt;negative critical reception&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; surprising.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I later found out the version I watched on a revisit was an
alternate ending, one that ends with a suicide. I don&#x27;t think the
de-facto one would have made the movie much better&#x2F;worse.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Among the best movies I&#x27;ve ever seen Jet Li star in, this is an
unforgiving portrayal of the brutality of war, and the horrid politics
surrounding it. I was amazed by some of the action, the highlight being
the cannon-hit-cannon moment, something I have never seen in any movie.
The movie itself was quite a surprise hit for me, for I never even heard
of it before, so I expected some passive actioner.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A revisit wasn&#x27;t as impressive, and in fact I found myself rather
impatient when it would end, and there isn&#x27;t great pleasure in the
sadness, and maybe also because I tend to look for an ideally good
character, instead of the lead character that Jet Li portrays, perhaps
the most complex he has done yet, more complete he has ever done
(sometimes he&#x27;s kind and sometimes not).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One bad casting choice was &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Takeshi_Kaneshiro&quot;&gt;Takeshi Kaneshiro&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, who plays one of the
three leaders and a narrator. He&#x27;s just not convincing in the role, or
maybe he&#x27;s just not a good enough actor.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Very enjoyable and well-made, but it feels a little thin in terms of
production design, and the camerawork does not fit a thriller so
gripping (this was fixed in the 2 sequels). There&#x27;s a bad performance
by the guy playing the African target, Clive Owen (playing one of the
assassins) was miscast and doesn&#x27;t do a good job. Matt Damon (Jason
Bourne) pulls the character quite well, and that&#x27;s kool for an actor I
don&#x27;t like.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;All is better&#x2F;bigger than the original: the intensity of the story, the
production design, the camerawork, and the car chase. All performances
are either good or beyond, if we don&#x27;t count Karl Urban (the Russian
assassin).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite bit of performance is given by the guy playing the assassin
Bourne duels early in the movie. Another well-directed one is the kid of
the murdered Russian couple. Joan Allen is as good as usual (not one
wrong move). Matt Damon does even better than in the first movie and so
does Julia Stiles.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/the-bourne-ultimatum-2007/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;If we ignore the more spectacular car chase&#x2F;crash, the movie is overall
lesser than the 2nd, but superior to the 1st of course. It&#x27;s not the
best because it feels like a mere rehash, and doesn&#x27;t bring much new to
celebrate, despite the fact the we get to know of Bourne&#x27;s past, but
even that is told in some badly-made flashbacks.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie got camerawork and production design very similar to the 2nd
movie, with similar intensity fo story, except that I got a bit bored
(remember the rehashness of it). It&#x27;s kinda strange because I remember
praising this concluding episode as superior to the rest.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Julia Stiles should not have been given a bigger role. She is not an
interesting enough actor. Even worse (worst performance in the trilogy)
is the guy playing the biker assassin. Other performances are decent
enough... nothing spectacular. Luckily, the last assassin here is
played quite well, better than any in the series.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;strong&gt;sidenote&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;] One uncomfortable aspect of this movie is that Bourne
really takes too much physical punishment to continue going. It was
forgiveable in the previous 2 movies, but in here it&#x27;s way too much (he
experiences so many heavy car crashes, and then simply walks out of
then). It&#x27;s sad because the series has been as close to convincing as
action movies are allowed, and that added to the fun.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Takes forever to start, and the delay isn&#x27;t filled with good
filmmaking. There&#x27;s some bad acting (lead, his gal, and best friend)
and some interesting ones (Alfred Molina and Sigourney Weaver), some
shitty story and kiddy romance, and little else that&#x27;s positive.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

old medical doctor into providing some info. Robert De Niro is
impressive, that is until we tire of his spurious appearance. The black
gal is intensely gorgeous, but I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s up with the
romp... maybe it was for the audience. Otherwise the movie is not very
interesting and the twist is shitty-ass.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;It does not even try to be a good movie, but then again it is an Adam
Sandler comedy. There&#x27;s some very hilarious moments, even though none
of them were original, except the ass-coconut moment.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One strange thing though is that I enjoyed Jennifer Aniston&#x27;s
performance, and for the first time (if memory serves well). I also
enjoyed the performance by the girl playing her daughter. Girls of that
age are hardly ever funny (or no one writer really tries), but she was.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;There&#x27;s a delightful&#x2F;fresh feel to it and there&#x27;s a bunch of fun
moments, but the whole thing is spoilt when it goes into typical
romantic comedy mode near the end, things like dozens of people
following a man who intends to propose, or a kid breaching airport
security to go mention his love for some gal. Bill Nighy and his manager
were fun to watch.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Great set design, camerawork, and costume design; a very dark story with
some disgusting elements; a very unbearable musical style (the singing
is often embarassing, and not very well-made, and exposes some bad
acting). I like the ugly actor (the aid of the evil judge), but he&#x27;s a
little too clown-like to celebrate.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;The filmmakers made sure that the disfigured man looked really
disgusting, and the idea is rather challenging, especially because I&#x27;d
lose my appetite if I shared a table. That doesn&#x27;t look very good
(what&#x27;s the difference between me and the racists?).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie is too slow and not very interesting, as if the makers relied
only on the curiosity of this shitty-looking and not much else. Those
who mistreated this guy should have been portrayed in a more convincing
way, because they just look mindless, as if the director was desperate
to make them look bad, just in case we wouldn&#x27;t notice.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Superb performances by all 3 people playing the writer girl, my favorite
being the youngest, which happens to be among the best child
performances I&#x27;ve ever seen. One other nice performance is the young
girl who eventually gets raped. I like the rather lame use of
type-writer sounds during certain sequences; I also like the expansive
sets showing bombed (World War II) areas as well as the military camp
(that wasn&#x27;t cheap). Otherwise the main story (a man gets
falsely-accused of rape) is boring and often full of sentimentality, and
I enjoyed none of the other performances.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Far less spectacular and less annoying (there&#x27;s no Keira Knighley or
Orlando Bloom) than the earlier movies, it does have nice humor,
gorgeous mermaids (wonderfully portrayed), and a totally enjoyable
performance by the fat guy who has Jack Sparrow brought in for
questioning, if we exclude the silly moment... the two-thumbs-up.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Good performances throughout and some of the best visualisations of fear
I&#x27;ve seen yet. Ben Kingsley is an amazingly adaptive actor, and his is
most likely the worst asshole I&#x27;ve seen in any movie... worse than Al
Pacino&#x27;s in &lt;em&gt;Scarface&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Bizarre movie with creatures, designed to look like dolls, done in bad
taste. Those creatures are however as realistic as it gets, and the
story tends to be spooky in places (e.g. one of them asks the
near-victim if he&#x27;d be good dinner). Catherine Keener, who plays the
mother of the lead character, is as impressive as always.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/irreversible-2002/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;A skillfully-done experimental tragedy told backwards, having among the
most horrific scenes I&#x27;ve yet seen in any movie, and I&#x27;m not referring
to the rape scene, prolonged as it was (isn&#x27;t it the longest rape scene
ever?). There&#x27;s good acting and dialog, complete with high levels of
realism.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <title>The Life of David Gale (2003)</title>
                <pubDate>Wed, 14 Dec 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
                <link>http://tshepang.net/the-life-of-david-gale-2003/</link>
                <guid>http://tshepang.net/the-life-of-david-gale-2003/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;A very well-made political drama focused on the issue of death penalty.
Full of good performances, my favorite being the lawyer of the title
character. I have, for a long time, considered it a masterpiece, which
was perhaps careless, considering that I don&#x27;t remember watching it
more than once. A revisit wasn&#x27;t quite as impactful, but the movie
remains impressive. The last twist is okay, but maybe needless (and
earned the movie dislike from many). A better twist happens earlier in
the movie.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The punishment that David Gale goes through, after cheating on his wife
and beeing falsely accused of rape, is rather too much, especially when
refused access to his child. It reminds me of the injustice suffered by
the ever-drunk lead character found in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;crazy-heart-2009&quot;&gt;Crazy Heart&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; at the hand of his
lover.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I watched this with high expectation, due the high critical acclaim it
possesses, but now have to wonder that the fuck is wrong with these
people. The story, an epic, resonates a bit with environmental care, so
I guess that&#x27;s part of its appeal, but the animation and visual design
is crappy as hell, and so is the dialog (likely partly because of shitty
translation).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/the-castle-1997/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;An awkward but witty comedy about a simple (and dumb) family on the
verge of being forcibly removed from their home due to an airport
extension. The movie&#x27;s best performance, though brief, was that of the
lawyer who took over the case. It was fun to watch his perplexed
reactions to the dumbness.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;There is much authenticity and freshness in the treament of poor South
African township experience, but there is also a lack of those since the
behaviour of some of the people is such that I&#x27;ve never witnessed (or
heard of, given the demographics of the setting) as a citizen of that
country... it&#x27;s little too westernized, and annoyingly so too. Also,
the language was a little too pure to be believable for anyone familiar
with it. The story is mildly interesting and acting decent, my favorite
being the prostitute teenager.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie is more important than it&#x27;s good, because it effectively
showcases the negative effects of denial and idiocy: &amp;quot;It&#x27;s not HIV,
I&#x27;m just not feeling okay; maybe it&#x27;s witchcraft; Friend, find me a
good traditional doctor; In the meanwhile, I&#x27;ll try these herbal
thingies&amp;quot;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;These 5 movies offered some of the best first-time viewing experiences I
ever had:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Monsters, Inc.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; (2001)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Incredibles&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; (2004)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Robots&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; (2005)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ratatouille&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; (2007)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall-E&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; (2008)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do they all have in common:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wonderful character design and development&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;enchanting&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a great&#x2F;exciting story concept&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest entrant on this list is &lt;em&gt;Megamind&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, a thoroughly satisfying
movie, which has the traditional hero&#x2F;villain thing, with a twist. The
character of the hero is simply amazing, for its deliberate
stereotypical design and development. The movie also has great costume
design. The title character is great fun to watch.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, one other characteristic of this list of movies is that the
appeal went down on a revisit, a very worrying trend, and that was the
case with &lt;em&gt;Megamind&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, though it wasn&#x27;t so devastating for it remains
excellent.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;A deliberately weird movie which is somewhat enjoyable, with some good
humor, some of which is rather silly, perhaps for the sake of being
bizarre. It&#x27;s nature also makes it hard to rate... I can&#x27;t call it
bad because there&#x27;s good direction (I was a bit captivated).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Me did not enjoy this psychological thriller starring an uninteresting
Leonardo Di Caprio. His character is investigating a missing patient in
some island prison for the criminally insane, and it drags on, inducing
sleep along the way. What&#x27;s the point?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;There&#x27;s a bunch of movies that showcase cultures where people
wear skimpy clothes and use heavy body modification, and this
is the best of them. There is also excellent casting and directing, and
an interesting story that&#x27;s spoiled by some plot holes:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How far can a human outrun a jaguar?&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How close can a 30m+ waterfall be to an ocean?&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How long can a human run with a wound that bad?&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, back to the good stuff: The environment where the human
sacrifices take place is among the richest ever committed to screen, and
the silly traditions aren&#x27;t embarassingly executed.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I like a few of the characters:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Medusa: gorgeous, yet scary&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Kraken: among the largest of all movie monsters I&#x27;ve seen,
complete with superb facial design&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The underworld creature that drives the boat, together with the two
others pulling the ship&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hades: the entrance +++ when spreading his &#x27;wings&#x27; +++ is
entrancing and the performance (Ralph Fiennes) and body movement
befitting; this the movie&#x27;s best moment&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were also some badly-designed ones:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The scorpions aren&#x27;t convincing, nor are the battles involving them&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The charred-skin wizards have some presence, but what the fuck is up
with look&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The former king who got burned by Zeus&#x27; lightning got make-up that
looks like something from a B-movie; that character is not
interesting too&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the story, it is merely standard. Nothing to celebrate there.
Strangely, I enjoyed the movie more on a revisit.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;The character design is quite impressive, all but the purple dog and the
monsters. The oversized warrior is an admirable character, due to his
great (and naive) kindness, and of course, his looks (design). The
movie&#x27;s best design is however the servant of the gal&#x27;s father, even
though it&#x27;s the kind seen before (that of villainous characters).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world of the movie is unlike I&#x27;ve seen before, a world with weird
gravitational behavior, with pieces of ground constantly breaking from
the land and floating in the air. It&#x27;s a dark story that, sadly, feels
too short.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;What&#x27;s up with people making depressing movies? This one is pretty
well-made, but it drags on and on with a boring love story. One thing of
value it portrays is that life tends to turn out different (and worse)
to what we hope&#x2F;expect.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Not much of a story, and all could have fit inside an hour, but the
makers decided to drag it on and on, with a fanatical lust for
showcasing extreme brutality. I found it to be a very good movie first
time I watched, but a revisit proves to damn unbearable. There way too
much screen presence of mother+prostitute duo; the conception of Satan
is both needless and badly done. It&#x27;s bad direction, and it makes me
wonder what the fuck Mel Gibson (director) was thinking. Maybe this is
his form of (expensive) masturbation, given that he&#x27;s a Christian and
all, so he maybe wasn&#x27;t thinking straight, perhaps obsessed of showing
just how much the lord suffered for us.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;A fun ride, following a former gangster trying to collect enough ransom
money to get son back. I&#x27;m not happy with the lead performance and the
pretty sidekick (so damn kissable!), but the rest of the cast is pretty
good, and the lead villain especially fearsome, though far less so than
on the first viewing. The ending is shitty and the police are too stupid
to be belieavable. The direction is quite good. It&#x27;s strange why the
movie wasn&#x27;t so popular in the Black community, especially since it&#x27;s
in the same level of the far-more-popular &lt;em&gt;Set It Off&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed this even more than the first time (which wasn&#x27;t the case
with the first movie). The humor is great, and so is the action, and
it&#x27;s overall better than the first movie, except that nothing beats the
escape sequence and the wobbly bridge fight. The villain is amazing, as
is his display of martial arts prowess. Sadly, the movie feels a bit too
short, and doesn&#x27;t take itself seriously at all.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;It has lost some of the intensity and edginess of the earlier viewings,
perhaps because there&#x27;s been heavier stuff since, but it maintains its
excellence (direction, acting, script, production design). It got a
great cast, minus Kim Bassinger as top-class prostitute, and the gal
playing the raped character. The best performance is by Kevin Spacey
(smooth-talking cop), followed by James Cromwell (police chief).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;A rather tired supernatural thriller about a boy tormented by ghosts and
a psychologist trying to help him. There isn&#x27;t much of a story, so the
director over-stretches it, resulting overly-long and boring moments.
The boy&#x27;s mom is given the movie&#x27;s best performance.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <title>Shrek Forever After (2010)</title>

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I didn&#x27;t expect much from this one, given that I find the series rather
overrated, bar the 2nd movie. But this one is quite an experience, and
far superior to any of them.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I liked:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the kid that insists on Shrek screaming&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Donkey was actually interesting&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the warrior Fiona was great to watch&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the villain was fun to watch, and his mannerisms reminds of that of
the title character of &lt;em&gt;Megamind&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the story is a lotta fun&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the Ogres species was fun to watch, and it was interesting to note
that he looked like nothing compared to some of them; character
design is amazing; check especially the cook&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;great humor: the villain serving the witches; the cook proposing
serving food during battle; the meet between fat cat and donkey&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the early scenes in which Shrek harks back to the early,
freedom-filled, days&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;update&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Movie revisits can be real strange. The first time I watched this one, I
deemed it a masterpiece, but a revisit proved it not much better than
the others in the &lt;em&gt;Shrek&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; franchise. It makes me wonder... maybe my
mood was different. It&#x27;s not as bad as the worst in the series (&lt;em&gt;Shrek
3&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;), but it doesn&#x27;t seem as good as the 2nd (&lt;em&gt;Shrek 2&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technically, it&#x27;s a little disappointing (the human faces are really
bad, not much better than the original &lt;em&gt;Toy Story&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; (1995). None of the
visuals are any impressive either, well other than Donkey&#x27;s fur, which
sometimes look photo-realistic. Luckily the new ogres are interesting,
far more interesting than Shrek himself, my most favorite being the
cook. And of the previous elements I watched, Fiona was no longer
interesting, and villain not as much fun nor is the story.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <pubDate>Wed, 07 Dec 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
                <link>http://tshepang.net/the-warrior-s-way-2010/</link>
                <guid>http://tshepang.net/the-warrior-s-way-2010/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;There is extreme brutality and violence, in this super-exciting fusion
of guns and swords. It&#x27;s rare to successfully mix Oriental and Western
fantasy. I don&#x27;t remember live-action fantasy martial arts so
impressively-executed (the ones that come close are &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;kung-fu-hustle-2004&quot;&gt;Kung Fu Hustle&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and
&lt;em&gt;House Of Flying Daggers&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;). The costume design is amazing, for both West
and East. The final battle is exhilarating. Shit, I wish I had words to
describe it. Did you check the ninjas? The sound?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie&#x27;s best performance was the head of the ninjas, while Geoffrey
Rush&#x27;s was just business as usual (nothing challenging for him here,
nor was it required). The gal is okay, and not as annoying as she could
have been.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The minor complaints I have is the unimpressive cowboy villain, and the
not-lethal-enough look of the lead (where&#x27;s Jet Li when you need him?).
I would also have preffered a less polished feel of the camerawork (it
feels too sanitised, too fantasy-like).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sidenotes&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was again wondering if there was something wrong with considering
the generally negative critical reception of the movie. Maybe they
are the ones who have problems. Were we watching the same movie?
Perhaps I will understand on a revisit.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I read &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.screendaily.com&#x2F;reviews&#x2F;the-warriors-way&#x2F;5021277.article&quot;&gt;a quality review&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; that does a good job of justifying its
negative conclusion.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am worried that this is another &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-case-of-the-matrix-reloaded&quot;&gt;Case of The Matrix Reloaded&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;update&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is indeed another &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-case-of-the-matrix-reloaded&quot;&gt;Case of The Matrix Reloaded&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. It is far less
impressive than on first viewing, but I still love the fantasy-like
fight sequences of the ninjas, but most especially, their
characterisation (they look as menacing as fuck). The part of the story
where the lead character gets to meet a gal and exercise a more relaxed
life is boring and not too well done. It reminds me of a similar kinda
thing in &lt;em&gt;Fearless&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, where Jet Li&#x27;s character goes to chill in a farm.
As if that&#x27;s not enough, both the lead character and the Amercian
villain are unconvincing, while the movie&#x27;s best performance is that of
the guy playing head of the ninjas.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the best &lt;em&gt;Toy Story&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; movie, and the only one I truly enjoyed.
The toys go through some elaborate adventures, ending up in some
seemingly hopeless situations, but luckily ending up surviving one way
or another. And the ending is as happy as can be. The environment, as
presented by the leader of the childcare toys, is so-gorgeous and
so-enchanting. The baby villain is quite scary, and the main villain is
unforgivably evil. My favorite characters are Rexx (the sweet dinosaur)
and the female cowboy (with her retarded voice). The clown, who makes a
first appearance here, is the best-designed character in the whole
series.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;update&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: A revisit was by far less enjoyable, but some moments remain
interesting (the Spanish mode), some charming ones (check the college
age toy owner with the toddler) and some great visuals (check the trash
sequence).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Touching drama about the oldest person (84) to start formal primary
school education. Well, it so happens that he met opposition (there&#x27;s
isn&#x27;t a shortage of idiots in the world). The guy playing him gives a
very good performance, and just as impressive are the schoolmates,
especially the kid with an artificial leg. She also happens to provide
the movie&#x27;s most tear-jerking moment, where she mentions a future
career of choice.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes these kids all the more impressive is that they were taken
from just two primary schools, which makes me assume they were
untrained.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story is paced a little too slow, although the horrendous past of
the old man is thrown in to help hold interest. Those flashbacks are too
frequent, unfortunately. Keeping the movie shorter would have been a
better solution.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;How do I review this? It&#x27;s a little weird and it makes me wonder why it
was made. There&#x27;s an interesting character in the form of an ugly
attorney, but it&#x27;s not a very fresh character. Penélope Cruz is also
interesting, but her character is also stale. Cameron Diaz&#x27;s is the
best character in the movie and some of her moments are quite painful
and hit a bit too close to home (check the complaint regarding lack of
commitment from her lover). She plays the role quite well too. The twist
is unexciting and the brain-teasing happenings not thrilling.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;John Travolta is interesting but the movie is the opposite, and is badly
written. It desperately tries to feel kool and fails, except for
Travolta, who sadly plays the same character he &#x27;always&#x27; plays (no
effort). Halle Berry is extra pretty, but her character is shit and so
is everyone else.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I was not a big fan of the original, but this one is even worse. It also
happens to be an excuse to give more screen time to the rusty car that I
suppose was a big hit in the first movie. There was some decent humor
but nothing fresh. Some of the visual are pretty good, but
inconsistently so, as if it was hastily put together... &amp;quot;we gotta go
make millions quick&amp;quot;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Tom Cruise plays one of my most favorite hitmen and in fitting
performance (his shortcomings aren&#x27;t so obvious) while Jamie Foxx
embarasses, especially later when more (he&#x27;s supposed to express great
distress and rebellion) is demanded from his boring performance.
Everyone else does very well, and the casting is excellent, as is the
direction, and the dialogue. The whole is very unpredictable and the
seemingly random nature of the story and the style of the camerawork
(the same used in the 2006 &lt;em&gt;Miami Vice&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;) gives the movie a certail level
of realism. It&#x27;s magnificent.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

elements.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;There&#x27;s some sleep-inducing moments, but it&#x27;s quite a good movie, and
interesting in places, with the main villain (Anthony Hopkins) being the
most interesting character, and Jodie Foster (the FNB agent the villain
toys with) looking as disrtubed-looking as usual.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;A bit disturbing with a gripping storyline. LL Cool J is an interesting
actor and so is the guy (in an interesting twist) who turns out to be
the villain. The setting (a simualtion of a small town, complete with
dolls&#x2F;statues for humans) is quite spooky, but the whole thing isn&#x27;t
satisfactorily justified, and the villain is too capable to convince (he
got too many things right in a very short period of time).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Some day I should simply stop punishing myself so much. I should learn
to quit the first sign I see trouble. My problem is high levels of
curiosity, for I&#x27;m often worried what I must miss, while wary of
passing judgement on a movie before watching its entirety.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s kinda hard to find an original and good romantic drama&#x2F;comedy, and
worse still, they tend to wallow in unbearable cheesiness. This one is
worsened by uninteresting leads, the Tom Cruise and Kirsten Dunst
look-alikes. It&#x27;s fucking weird how come movies like this still get
made at all, because there&#x27;s absolutely nothing new in it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;A mostly uninteresting and irritating mixture of 2D animation and live
action, which luckily has an ultra-sexy wife of the title character. No
one else is interesting, unless you want to mention the brief appearance
of the pig &amp;quot;that&#x27;s all folks&amp;quot; and Bugs Bunny. The movie is also badly
directed and acted, and it&#x27;s strange considering that the director is
Robert Zemeckis. Maybe the producers (the money people) got in the way.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I didn&#x27;t expect much from this one because I watched the trailer, which
exposed uninteresting visual and character design and a weak lead actor.
The movie turned out even worse than I expected, with an unbearably bad
and ludicrous story. Not even the visual effects help, because none of
them are any good. How can everything in the movie suck so bad!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, the ugly guy who was to train the lead was a little interesting,
even though the character is recycled. The concept of a device that
allows one to create temporary matter-energy simply by willpower is kool
too.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/the-secret-of-kells-2009/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s bizarre in a way similar to &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-triplets-of-belleville-2003&quot;&gt;The Triplets of Belleville&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and has
some emotionally powerful moments.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highlights:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the attack scene was quite painful; it&#x27;s some of sort of reminder
of the tough realities of the world&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the character development of Ashley, the forest creature that helped
the hero on a few occasions, was quite interesting; it was
especially sad when her great strength was challenged by some evil
creature of the same forest, especially when her form changed to
express the pain&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the general character design&#x2F;development is quite good really; my
favorites are the strict leader of the town and the fat guy&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the cat is among the most charming characters I&#x27;ve seen in movie
history&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the negative side, the movie is a little disturbing&#x2F;unsettling (okay,
that&#x27;s not a negative), and is also sleep-inducing. I also couldn&#x27;t
get what the point of it was. Maybe it&#x27;s kinda biblical, since it
centers around some all-important book (and the lead character looks
like Jesus when grown-up).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Not very interesting, even with the ultra-gorgeous Catherine Zeta-Jones.
I didn&#x27;t get a chance to watch it all these years, even though I had
mild attraction due to my previous love for the featured item, the
Petronas Towers. The amount of money to be stolen by the lead characters
is ludicrous and is suitable only for comedies, or at least it should
have been more convincing.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;The initial scene, leading up to the point where wonderboy saves a few
lives, is handled very well, complete with good suspense. But it seems
that&#x27;s where all the effort in the movie went, because the rest is just
average fare. The story is quite thin, so there was a lot of boring
fillers (and uninteresting acting) just so the thing can last ~100
minutes. The villain wasn&#x27;t interesting either, though I remember
greater excitement on the first viewing.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;The lead character has got talent (I&#x27;ve seen him on stage), but either
he&#x27;s just not good enough for this role or the director just didn&#x27;t
push hard enough. Also, I suspect that the movie would come off better
was I unfamiliar with the language used... if you ask any ordinary
black South African, it&#x27;s quite unconvincing.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First time I watched this, I was hoping that it would match the
excellent SA township tv series, Yizi Yizo, and it failed dismally. It
was still hard-hitting and skillfully portrays some of the poor township
realities of the country, but it turned more towards some sort of
morality play. I guess it&#x27;s a matter of taste, but it should at least
have been convincing.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;highlights:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the camerawork and the sets; I remember the music sounding superior
the first time I saw the movie&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the comic performance by one &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rottentomatoes.com&#x2F;celebrity&#x2F;kenneth-nkosi&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Kenneth Nkosi&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, who plays the dumb,
yes-man gang member&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the scene regarding title characters&#x27;s childhood was quite good,
complete with excellent performances from the young boy and his
father&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;nice performance by Zola, who runs an operation where he strips and
re-sells stolen car parts&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;It started reasonably well and slowly worked its way down into badly
recycled material. The adventure feels artificial, the villain
uninteresting, the characters shallow as shit, but worst of all is what
happens near the end. In my (pitiful) memory, this is the second worst
movie Nicolas Cage has been in (remember &lt;em&gt;Ghost Rider&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;It got the same sort of camerawork and set design (set about the same
time?) as &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;recent-movies-2010-05-06&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;An Education&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and it also happens to be a coming-of-age
story, only a lot less serious and a lot more of a fairy-tale. The
acting is decent, but Ralph Fiennes isn&#x27;t convincing... more a
caricature than a shitty husband.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trivia: I don&#x27;t remember anyone mocking own father as the troubled kid
does here.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Ever went into a movie and realise within the first minute it&#x27;s not
going to be any good? If proven right, it can become a painful
experience, and you can&#x27;t wait for the end to come, because it&#x27;s not
so bad that it&#x27;s unwatcheable. What made me notice the early badness?
The very first two people to appear on screen (&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Paul_Bettany&quot;&gt;Paul Bettany&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Karl_Urban&quot;&gt;Karl
Urban&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;) and their poses (they are vampire killers) are very telling.
Worse still, we have &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cam_Gigandet&quot;&gt;Cam Gigandet&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; as the sidekick. The story is so
unexciting, the climax is rushed and the post-apocalyptic world is
recycled and unexplained. The only bright spot I can remember is the
vampires themselves, even though the design isn&#x27;t original; it is
similar to that of the monsters in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;i-am-legend&quot;&gt;I Am Legend&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Descent&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;An embarassing lead performance by Chow Yun Fat; with the help of
unimpressive direction and script, it showcases silly ancient Chinese
traditions, as if they were somehow virtuous. Oh, and I still wondered
what&#x27;s so great the title character did for the world, other than at
times using his influence to try exert kindness to his world. I would
have preferred some time spent on explaining how he actually gained that
influence... and I&#x27;m not visiting his Wikipedia article.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;A fun and lazily-written movie set in ancient mythical times; there&#x27;s a
number of hilarious moments and fun characters, my favorite of which are
Caine (first biblical murderer) and the high priest. Sadly, the fun
isn&#x27;t very consistent (hence the work &#x27;lazy&#x27;), but it&#x27;s enough to
keep one interested. The most hilarious moments ought to be the one
involving foreskins.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;This was much more engaging when I was a kid, and it hasn&#x27;t aged well
at all. It&#x27;s an uninteresting and pointless story about two cops
patroling some dingy neighbourhood, and about the gangsters they come
across. The direction is dry and... ah, boring.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;An entertaining fantasy about some heroic warrior fighting demons in
hell in order to reach his loves. It&#x27;s moderately well-made and has
some interesting animation (check when Satan forcibly pulls that lover
towards self), but the storyline skimps through the details, and feels
shallow... it feels incomplete.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Poking a lotta fun at some the blind adherance and factionalism that is
all too common in society, and doing it in a very humorous way. This is
brilliant humor by the way. The effort of making the costumes and the
environment feel authentic is impressive. The only real annoyance is the
character of Brian&#x27;s mom.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, unlike &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;monty-python-s-quest-for-the-holy-grail-1975&quot;&gt;Holy Grail&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, it doesn&#x27;t feel too much like a

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Lots of excellent humor (&lt;em&gt;the machine that goes PING&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;welcome to the
middle of the movie&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;baby falling from pussy&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, ...), perhaps even
funnier than &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;monty-python-s-life-of-brian-1979&quot;&gt;Life of Brian&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, though it was quite a surprise that it
resorted to vomit humor, and the most disgusting in memory.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one was also disorganised as a whole movie, though not as much as
&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;monty-python-s-quest-for-the-holy-grail-1975&quot;&gt;Holy Grail&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Its being very feel-good is ironic, given that its main character is as
pessimistic a guy as it gets, insulting people everywhere and getting
away with it (reminding of Gregory House from the series, &lt;em&gt;House&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;).
There&#x27;s interesting acting, and I really like the part where the
characters look at the camera, perplexed at what they are supposed to
see.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fresh as it feels, the movie really smacks of laziness. Woody Allen is a
talented movie maker, but he didn&#x27;t really put much effort here, or at
least it doesn&#x27;t feel like it. The movie feels like a glorified sitcom,
and it&#x27;s fantasy-like, with quirky happenings here and there, and
doesn&#x27;t feel like one solid whole. This isn&#x27;t what I want from
theatre.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Goog ole-fashioned action movie, with a deliberately sgallow storyline
and two beloved leading ladies, one (Jessica Alba) of which has never
performed this well anywhere (in my experience of course). The leading
guy, an ugly motherfucker who I only ever saw doing secondary roles, if
fun to watch. He does look like a tough guy. Steven Seagal is as scary
as always, and I wonder what the fuck Robert De Niro is doing here.
Aren&#x27;t there more cerebral scripts for him out there?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I fell in love with this one years ago when I watched it first time, and
a revisit didn&#x27;t disappoint at all. The characters are very
well-developed and it&#x27;s easy to fall in love with them. This most
especially applies to Edward James Olmos, who gives a wonderful
performance as a stubborn fisherman husband. His son is excessively
annoying, and his wife excessively desirable.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&#x27;s extra kool about the movie is that the cheaters aren&#x27;t
portrayed like villains, but rather, victims of lust. At the same time,
it&#x27;s still not portrayed as an okay thing to do, but the 2nd-last scene
was a little too much.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of all movies that cover the subject of infidelity, this is probably the
best.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Demi Moore is still so damn gorgeous after all these years! The movie is
a real good play on the concept of &lt;em&gt;kool neighbors&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; even though it fails
to end it well. It takes the concept a little far, meaning they fail to
make it believable, but luckily the whole thing is kept entertaining.
The subplots (cheating hubby and homosexuality) were left ununsed and
were therefore needless, as if thw writers didn&#x27;t have a filler...
lack of creativity?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Some of its moments are so bad that they are hard to bear. There&#x27;s some
uninteresting acting too, e.g. the frail Captain America and the love
interest. None of the other performances are really good, and the
villain is embarassingly bad, as if from some low-budget sci-fi movie.
The script is bad and it&#x27;s strange that the movie comes from the same
studio as &lt;em&gt;Iron Man&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. There isn&#x27;t even decent visual effects to lessen
the pain. Luckily, the final-form Captain America hero is fun to watch.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;An okay and shallow romantic comedy; there&#x27;s some bad make-up for the
lead character in her early scenes; none of the acting is any good and
the male romantic lead is especially bad, as if he&#x27;s embarassed or
something; it&#x27;s interesting watching warm human relationships like the
Greeks in the movie have.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Very funny (favorite moment is the unloaded gun scene), and some of the
humor is very original. The movie is in the style (the goofiness) of the
other Will Ferrell vehicle, &lt;em&gt;Blade of Glory&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Andr%C3%A9_3000&quot;&gt;André 3000&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is
interesting to watch and, with talent like this, me wonders why he
isn&#x27;t working more regularly in movies.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Though not as enjoyable as I was hoping this revisit to be, Sharon Stone
is still quite a pleasure to watch. Michael Douglas isn&#x27;t very
interesting nor is anyone else. The sexual energy was rather silly (did
we need to have near-rape in the story). Also, the movie isn&#x27;t aging
well (check the 80&#x27;s fashion for one).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;My memory sucks but this is the best chick flick I&#x27;ve seen yet.
Although some of the humor is recycled, it doesn&#x27;t feel so. Much of it
is quite good and original. There are good performances from the lead
and the lady getting married. The traffic cop isn&#x27;t bad either, but the
movie&#x27;s most interesting character is the masculine lady. I haven&#x27;t
quite experienced a tomboy character done this way. There&#x27;s the
suckiness that is so common with romantic comedies (the fallout between
best friends), and worse, merely brushed away.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On another note, it&#x27;s interesting the kind of effort that goes into
mindless things like wedding ceremonies.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;There isn&#x27;t much going for this one, except I admire one of the
characters (in his early forties) falling in love with an elderly lady.
The movie is not unbearable but it should be given a miss. Chris Rock
shows again his extreme lack of acting skill and Salma Hayek hasn&#x27;t
lost her position as among the most beautiful women on the planet. That
old lady gives a nice performance BTW and she looks pretty for her age.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;After watching what felt like a waste of time, I was surprised to find
that &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Midnight_Meat_Train#Reception&quot;&gt;there were those who found it decent&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. The villain is given a
laughably bad performance by &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Vinnie_Jones&quot;&gt;Vinnie Jones&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. I don&#x27;t remember any of
his work any good.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some parts of the movie are decent:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the intrigue the lead character goes through as he unravels the
mystery that is the serial killer&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the lady our lead character tries to impress with his art&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;This was dealt a harsh blow by critics and, although I don&#x27;t like it
much, I don&#x27;t see how it&#x27;s any worse than typical American romantic
comedies. It&#x27;s as annoying as they tend to be (hard-to-bear romance
with an overlong &#x27;sulking&#x27; period) but it has some good humor.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I always found the characters of Asterix &amp;amp; Obelix series fascinating.
Most interesting was the kindly Obelix, the overweight warrior who
happens to be the toughest of them all. The voice talent he&#x27;s given
here is pretty good.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this rather quirky movie, the more interesting character is Abba, the
daughter of the Viking king. She isn&#x27;t an originial creation, but her
sass, her tough-gal attitude, and her front-teeth gap makes her fun to
watch. I also liked the dumb son of the villain. There&#x27;s good humor
sprinkled all the place.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I don&#x27;t remember enjoying any of Eric Bana&#x27;s performances until now;
two of American&#x27;s great sweethearts are here (the ridiculously
desirable Scarlett Johanssen and the sophisticated and disturbing
Natalie Portman). The are other good performances, and none is better
than that of &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ana_Torrent&quot;&gt;Anne Torrent&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; who plays the queen&#x27;s first wife.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie starts off as yet-another English period drama (though I liked
the detailed look at the lives of the rich and pwoerful at the time),
but the intensity of the events at the end almost led me to call it
overall excellent.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/9-2009/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;A weird post-apocalypse movie about bizarre puppet-like creatures trying
to survive in a world where they are terrorised by some scary robot
whose goal is left untold. The action is top-class and the adventure
heavy, with many cliffhanger moments, but the central premise (mentioned
in the twist) is damn silly. Character design is pretty good (the main
villain is awesome and so are its minions) while character development
is typical.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

those movies that make you lucky to live in today&#x27;s South Africa,
because it shows abuses of human freedom in East Germany in the
mid-80&#x27;s. The acting is pretty good, especially by the guy who is
taking part in the spying of the palywright. The very last moment is a
tearjecker.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I was attracted by the high-tech action, thinking that&#x27;s what the movie
was about, but I was soon disappointed; the all-too-common cheap
sentiments were unbearable; the humor, though not fresh (except the
begging-for-food part), was fun. Great voice talent and sound.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;It feels dated and Annette Benning is so damn pretty. It was hard not to
compare the movie with &lt;em&gt;The West Wing&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; tv series (I saw the first two of
its seasons). The whole thing feels shallow. The &lt;em&gt;oh shit! it really is
the president&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; thing is so lame and boring. Ok, there was too much of it
in the tv series. Why do I feel like some episodes of that series were
actually better. Sure the debates and storylines of that series were
deeper and more complex, but some episodes were actually more exciting
than this movie.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Lacking the intensity of its &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-experiment-2010&quot;&gt;remake&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and its lead character not as
heroic (and even annoying), I was left unsatisfied. For its remake, the
injustices begin very early during the movie (perhaps within 30
minutes), while for this one, they begins only in the last 30 minutes.
They however go way too far to be believable (e.g. attempted rape). The
romance is beautiful (did you see that gal!), but they just had to push
it as far as the gal having a part in the violence.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;The uninteresting first scene, that of the playful title character
having fun, made me not want to proceed to the rest, but the ultra-sweet
female love interest and the eye she had for the museum tour guide led
me on. It isn&#x27;t much, and has some unbearable and formulaic happenings
(e.g. the evil son of the museum owner, the break-up between the tour
guide, and the got-to-get-the-monkey-back shit). I managed to muster a
smile here and there as well.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

sensual.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;To make up for its extreme shallowness, the movie is very exciting. I
liked the concept of supreme Civil and Mechanical engineering abilities
of the little people. I also enjoyed how the movie made fun of old,
formal-sounding English. The movie also happens to be a Jack Black
vehicle, and this guy has some real good humor. What else me liked is
the robot. Also, the water effects (the storm) are amazing.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Exquisite cinematography, (excessively) loving characters, and some of
the best depictions of Italian food and romance. The lead character
looks so damn nice at the wedding. The movie is overlong (it drags) and
has some unbearable romance. I like romance, but not when it&#x27;s so
blatantly formulaic. Maybe if I was a stereotypical female, I&#x27;d melt.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

uninteresting, and so was Bruce Willis and the girlfriend). But I really
like the eye-pleasing &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Rebecca_Pidgeon&quot;&gt;Rebecca Pidgeon&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, who plays the opponent&#x27;s boss.
I just wish that opponent would have been played by a better actor than
&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Karl_Urban&quot;&gt;Karl Urban&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Too much in here is unbrearably irritating (the two imaginary
characters, the asshole boyfriend, the slapstick) and uninteresting. The
movie is a horrible experience, though that was eased by the warm
moments between the lead and the stupid (allowing self to be treated
like trash by irritating boyfriend) gal.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;An okay torture movie where a number of strippers get abducted by a
religious nut claiming to cleanse them of sin. It&#x27;s pretty much stupid
and made worse by its ineffective documentary style. Luckily, the acting
isn&#x27;t bad, though only &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Michael_Rooker&quot;&gt;Michael Rooker&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; stands out.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;When you got recycled (and shallow and stupid) material, the least you
can do is make it interesting. On the bright side, character animation
for the human when in the large spacesuit is fun to watch, especially
when dancing on stage.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/shadowboxer-2005/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;The main plot, that of an assassin softened by an innocent being, has
been done a number of times before. But the movie remains fresh. It&#x27;s
clear that the writer is politically liberal, bordering on provocative.
Most notable is the sexual relationship between a young black guy (Cuba
Gooding, jnr.) and an elderly white lady (the beautiful Helen Mirren),
something I don&#x27;t remember portrayed in movies before. As a sidenote,
it&#x27;s probably these two roles that got them in later movies (&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-hit-list-2011&quot;&gt;The Hit
List&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;red-2010&quot;&gt;Red&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, respectively).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie pretty much weird, with the sort of direction I haven&#x27;t seen
before. It didn&#x27;t see much distribution, and I only watched it because
I deeply enjoyed the director&#x27;s later work, &lt;em&gt;Precious&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;It starts impressively well (the backstage, complete with the bony lady)
but soon devolves into a drag that doesn&#x27;t really go anywhere. The
direction is good, and the lead character superbly-developed. It&#x27;s just
not a match for the director&#x27;s earlier masterful &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-triplets-of-belleville-2003&quot;&gt;Triplets of

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Nicole Kidman has played troubled women quite a few times before, but
the performance she gives here is quite fresh, and really unlike
anything I&#x27;ve seen before, either from her or anyone else. The
character she plays is also quite throughly developed, and my shitty
memory says she is the greatest female asshole I&#x27;ve seen yet in any
movie. This character is grieving of son&#x27;s accidental death.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guy playing the killer gives the movie&#x27;s best performance, and
perhaps the best teenage performance in any movie (remember the quality
of my memory). He&#x27;s fucking amazing. And this is a movie not having any
shortage of excellent acting. Most notably, we have &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Sandra_Oh&quot;&gt;Sandra Oh&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, who is
as desirable as she is excellent. She is a good actor, but she hasn&#x27;t
in my eyes done anything better than this.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;m still not sure about Aaron Eckhart. Not a bad performance at all,
but he&#x27;s too uninteresting. I&#x27;m also not sure about the lady playing
the mother. Not bad either, but not too beliavable.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dialog is quite good and so is the camerawork. The great direction
easily hides the fact the movie itself is pretty much plotless.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I found the first third unbearable, and the whole thing is rather trite
and recycled. Things become better when the bird wearing a bottle cap as
a hat charms me. The street celebrations are beautiful. Regardless, this
isn&#x27;t Pixar-quality, complete with shitty, supposed-to-be-kool music
and singing.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Given the top-of-the-range quality of the animation and character
design, this is a largely unnteresting adventure story of an
annoyingly-deceptive reptile in thirsty Wild West town. Lucily there&#x27;s
some colorful characters:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the freedom-fighter gal with her heavy America South accent&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the old and wise guy who got run over by a car, with his heavy
Mexican accent&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the snake, whose creation must have been the single most complex
character in the whole movie, and perhaps among the most complex
digital characters ever&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#x27;s great voice talent, but the story, not so much.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I once declared this one a masterpiece, perhaps due to the superb
direction, and the weird and wonderful storyline. Those remain
appealing, but a revisit wasn&#x27;t so favorable.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#x27;s nice performances all over the show (Laura Dern, Elias Kotes,
Helena Bonham Carter, Kevin Bacon, and all supporting characters).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;A re-imagining of a &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;seven-samurai-1954&quot;&gt;Seven Samurai&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, complete with its Toshiro
Mifune (the forest guy who is looked-down upon for not being a samurai,
and his slight rebellion), its charismatic leader, battle and acting
style (one wouldn&#x27;t guess that it was made only in 2010). The villain
is excessively brutal, more than any that Akira Kurosawa committed to
screen (if memory serves well). Luckily, the movie isn&#x27;t soiled with
the silly characters that were so common in Akira&#x27;s movies.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Embarrassingly bad, recycled shit, which would have one fooled early on,
due to decent camerawork and atmosphere. Sadly, soon enough we see some
bad acting and dramatisations. Not even the martial arts rescue it. The
brutality is laughable.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, I must find something positive. Ummmm... I like the sworn brother,
the one who proposes arranged marriage. The villain&#x27;s performance is
quite good as well, but only before he gains power, because afterwards
he brings some unexciting swagger, you know the one that has been done
how many times before.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s okay to rehash stuff, but if you do it worse than everyone else,
eish! I hate pretentious movies. This one wanted to be a memorable epic,
a masterpiece even, but it&#x27;s a cheap imitation. Disgusting.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <pubDate>Sun, 08 May 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/the-case-of-the-matrix-reloaded/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;THere are so many movies that excite me so much that I nearly shake, but
I don&#x27;t think there any that matches the experience I once had when I
watched &lt;em&gt;The Matrix Reloaded&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, the first sequel to the 1999 classic.
That I was at a cinema, complete with booming sound, contributed to the
experience.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were many sequences responsible, but there were two in particular
the rocked my world:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An early scene where Trinity continues shooting the Agents while
falling of a tall building. It was not only the concept, but the
visuals of this particular sequence were jaw-dropping.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Burly Brawl scene, where Neo fights off multiple copies of Agent
Smith. As with the falling sequence, it was both the concept and
execution that made me so god damn excited.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is movie magic. I even went as far as declaring the movie a
masterpiece. That&#x27;s a rare accolade for a movie to possess. I did this
not blind to the movie&#x27;s flaws (I was very well aware of the
less-than-excellent story). It&#x27;s just that the excitement was so great
that the flaws seemed like minor blemishes in comparison. Sadly, that
wasn&#x27;t a case on a revisit.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The true test of a movie&#x27;s excellence is on a revisit, or better still,
on multiple revisits. The movie must remain excellent even when it is no
longer the-new-hot-thing, when other masterworks have been released.
&lt;em&gt;The Matrix Reloaded&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; isn&#x27;t such a movie. The visual effects, it&#x27;s
best asset, even looked cartoonish on a revisit (thought still great),
and felt like putting make-up on a rotting corpse (a stupid story). Not
it&#x27;s not a bad movie, just not a very good one.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, &lt;em&gt;The case of The Matrix Reloaded&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is whereby I ecstatically declare
supreme a movie on the initial viewing, a movie that proves a complete
let-down on a revisit.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s got some good elements, and the lead actor, Cole Hauser, is really
great on screen. The direction of the opening scenes (following the
stressed-out hero, nd his meeting with the killer) is pretty good. The
violence near the end is quite weird, and mentioning it would be a
spoiler.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would have appreciated a better budget and superior camerawork. Cuba
Gooding jnr. is badly cast as the killer (he&#x27;s damn unconvincing). The
story is thing and shallow, and the cheating thing painted in a lighter
way was just unneeded, as if fucking is a greater cheating crime than
kissing. Really?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;A very fresh assassin movie with great romance (did you see that gal?)
and sound effects. The story is so thin (and rather meditative) that I
don&#x27;t know what to make of the movie. Many unexplained things happen,
but I guess that&#x27;s not exactly a weakness. Rather, it&#x27;s implied. The
uncomfortable situation our protagonist finds self in is quite edgy, and
it makes me wanna NOT become a gangster. The intense violence is always
unsettling, especially if it&#x27;s merely imminent.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/tangled-2010/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;An enchanting fantasy with superb character design (the evil old lady,
the drunkards, and the 2 outlaws), amazing action sequences, and nice
humor. It&#x27;s originality is in having a horse in a different role than
in anything I&#x27;ve seen yet.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ending (&#x27;climax&#x27;) feels forced, and does not do justice to the
rest of the movie; the movie is a musical, and none of it is
embarassing, but the love song (on the boat) is the low point...
boring.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;strong&gt;sidenote&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;] I didn&#x27;t expect much from this one, simply because I
never heard it mentioned before. Note also that, for a few years now, I
don&#x27;t really check out what&#x27;s on the circuit.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;An exercise in embarassment. &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;let-the-right-one-in-2008&quot;&gt;The first novel-to-movie adaptation&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; was
released only 2-3 years before. I thought they wanted to offer something
else, maybe a budget, with some visual flair. But there&#x27;s nothing. In
fact there is an uninteresting &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Elias_Koteas&quot;&gt;Elias Koteas&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; as the investigator (there
was basically none in the earlier movie), and the companion of the
vampire (played by an extrememly uninteresting &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Richard_Jenkins&quot;&gt;Richard Jenkins&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, who
bored me horrendously in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;eat-pray-love-2010&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eat Pray Love&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;). But these greedy
motherfuckas just wanted to exploit a good story, and give nothing in
return. In fact, the even got lazy, walking briskly over material that
was dealth with more depth in the first movie. But, I don&#x27;t know the
details of the novel, so who knows, they might be more faithful than the
first movie. So I guess they just wanted to make an extra buck from an
audience that&#x27;s too lazy to read subtiles.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While watching this, I kept wondering if would I give it more praise had
I not seen (or known) about the original movie. I&#x27;m not sure, because
it comes across as yet-another-horror movie, even though there&#x27;s a gal
vampire. But that&#x27;s not exactly a new concept (remember &lt;em&gt;Interview With
A Vampire&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;). It&#x27;s not even remotely interesting. What&#x27;s most puzzling,
beyond that the shit (it&#x27;s not that smelly, I just hate it) got made is
the &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Let_Me_In_(film)#Critical_response&quot;&gt;positive response&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; it received from critics. WTF!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Some serious storytelling here and is unlike anything I&#x27;ve seen before,
other than a resemblance to the mini-series, &lt;em&gt;Blood In, Blood Out&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. An
epic prison movie, though something I don&#x27;t really wanna see again.
There&#x27;s very little happy things going on. There&#x27;s a beautiful visual
(the accident) and an interesting concept (one guy taking on a few
gunmen).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with movies is that they tend to go through different
episodes, which sadly often don&#x27;t quite compare to each other. This
situation is worse for long movies like this one (3hrs). The setup is
quite intense. It&#x27;s so good that I was expecting more than what
ultimately transpired (the slow rise of our &#x27;hero&#x27; through the ranks,
and the complex politics surrounding him). It&#x27;s good direction, but it
could have been better, and this lead of hours, although he competently
leads the movie, falls short at times. Reminds me of Liam Neeson in
&lt;em&gt;Schindler&#x27;s List&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <title>Apocalypse Now (1979)</title>
                <pubDate>Mon, 25 Apr 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/apocalypse-now-1979/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;The first hour is nothing short of masterful. I&#x27;m referring here to
goosebumps that only result from supreme artistic excellence. I am
referring more specifically to the movie&#x27;s first battle, the merciless
attack led by Robert Duvall. Not only is it amazing to watch, but Robert
Duvall&#x27;s performance is mesmerising. His character&#x27;s eccentricity
(insane bravery and obsession with surfing) is unforgettable. It&#x27;s one
indication of the director&#x27;s love for being over-the-top, and it works
quite well, in the first hour.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marlon Brando has very powerful moments dedicated to his character, a
twisted fuck who revels in intense horror. He doesn&#x27;t appear in much of
the movie, and is filmed with reverance of a prophet, reminding me of
the old man in the early scenes of &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;seven-samurai-1954&quot;&gt;Seven Samurai&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Dennis Hopper does a
wonderful turn as his admirer, in the only one of his performances that
I actually find enjoyable.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite this, I am not going to neglect to mention some questionable
casting choices:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Martin Sheen is not bad, but there must have been someone more
suitable. Nice voice though, especially when he narrates.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The driver of the boat sucks, and he sucked in &lt;em&gt;Malcolm X&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; too.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&#x27;m not sure about Laurence Fishburne; he seems too artificial,
like some sorry attempt to keep the story interesting.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Harrison Ford looks like ineffective comic relief, without being
one.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the quality of being over-the-top worked well in the first
hour, that was not exactly the case elsewhere. For one, the Playboy
antic was acceptable. But as if that wasn&#x27;t enough, they (later on, for
some silly and unjustified reason) also had to fuck the travelling men.
There was also the moment at a dinner table with the French. Note that
these moments were very well done, but they just don&#x27;t live up to what
the first hour promised. They almost seem like desperate attempts at
keeping the whole thing exciting. Yes, and that wasn&#x27;t enough still, so
there had to be sex and romance too. Regardless, the gal rocks so hard,
complete with the face and sensuality of the magnificent Tilda Swinton.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hate the shortcomings of the, for I would be happy to name it a
masterpiece. Surely this is a work of visual excellence, and is showered
with amazing cinematography and, especially, production design. The only
war movie that is any match on both these elements is &lt;em&gt;Saving Private
Ryan&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. Maybe that&#x27;s a careless statement, but then again my memory is
hardly ever impressive.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The version I watched is the one released in 2001, fully titled
&lt;em&gt;Apocalypse Now Redux&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;A great childhood favorite of mine, this is a small, fast-moving, and
senseless fun ride, following a few broke-ass high school kids, chasing
gals and fun. It got wonderful music, and superb casting and character
development.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Excessively bizarre, and disturbing at times I couldn&#x27;t figure what the
fuck the story is about; the whole is unbearable, and the experience is
made worse by it&#x27;s 3hr length. How can people get away with so much
audience torture? Worse still, there are mainstream critics who called
it &lt;em&gt;brilliant&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. What did I miss?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the most original of all vampire movies I&#x27;ve seen. Nice
performance from the little gal playing the vampire. Also, though it
kills the innocent, you do feel compassion for it. It&#x27;s origins are
sadly left unexplained. It remained captivating throughout even though
the pacing is slow and the gloss is limited.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;strong&gt;sidenote&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;] The re-make had good reviews, so I went into it
excited, only to be &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;let-me-in-2010&quot;&gt;seriously disappointed&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;A run-of-the-mill horror that, luckily, has pretty gals and decent
camerawork. There is nothing new and the twist is underwhelming. What I
like about it is that it&#x27;s not pretentious, and is devoid of arrogance.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When people spend so much effort on a movie, I wonder how they the
justify the question, &lt;em&gt;what makes this stand above the rest?&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;A revenge story, and not much else. The sexual spontaneity of the couple
deeds is strange, and isn&#x27;t justified. The story setup is made to look
like there was more than what actually transpired.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I had to watch this one a few times in pieces because it was too boring
to bear. It&#x27;s a sleep-inducing exercise, following an extremely
uninteresting semi-retarded lady who is suffering from an untold
incident, as well as the guilt of (potentially) hitting a human with her
car. We are led to keep hoping that something will actually happen, but
nothing does. Luckily the acting is good and so is direction and
camerawork.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;strong&gt;sidenote&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;] There is one critic who &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;nytimes.com&#x2F;2009&#x2F;08&#x2F;19&#x2F;movies&#x2F;19headless.html&quot;&gt;found it great&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, inspiring me
to give it a second look. It&#x27;s a better and deeper review than mine.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Quality direction can successfully mask an okay storyline. As evidence
of that, this sucky movie has a &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;true-grit-2010&quot;&gt;a far better movie&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; based on that same
story. And it&#x27;s not like that much-younger movie takes advantage of
superior visuals of anything like that.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also do not get the appeal of John Wayne; why did anyone thinks he&#x27;s
any interesting.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Quality dialog throughout and decent acting. Some big names are
involved, but it&#x27;s interesting that they stayed away from expensive
gloss, and instead focused on the simple story of &lt;em&gt;we gotta find this
killer&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;strong&gt;sidenote&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;] One critic &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.observer.com&#x2F;2010&#x2F;culture&#x2F;year-end-roundup-what-see-and-skip-ball-drops?page=1&quot;&gt;complained&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;True_Grit_(2010_film)&quot;&gt;via&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;) about Jeff Bridge&#x27;s
self-indulgent performance, and I totally agree. The guy is a fine
actor, but he really was getting too comfortable. I would not go as far
as saying the performance was any bad at all, as the critic claims. It
seems he disliked it so much that he decided to go all irrational on us.
It was probably just a lashback against the overwhelming (undeserving)
acclaim the movie got.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Watching the first half of the movie, I saw a &lt;em&gt;Se7en&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; (urban decay and
the brutal violence on some of its citizens; the tough cops
investigating; oh, and the glorious ending). Yeah, it was quite intense,
with a different touch of a lower budget and less glitzy style, but very
effective. This was helped by an amazing cast, all well until the guy
playing the informant shows his shortcomings near the end. Wonderful
setup and script, until an unsatisfying (and unjustified) ending. The
horrid deeds are unjustified too, and the movie doesn&#x27;t offer the
intense emotional impact when the credits roll. You see, movie endings
are extremely important, because if they are shitty, they really mess
the glory that may have already been presented. I didn&#x27;t care much for
the resonation with &lt;em&gt;Saw&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; movies, for the story didn&#x27;t need it. This is
a movie that should have risen above that level.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;good&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amazing camerawork.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vera Farmica is immensely beloved (as usual).&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Her two kids are amazing, especially the daughter.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The title character is quite good too, a superb child performance.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;C._C._H._Pounder&quot;&gt;CCH Pounder&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; as the lead nun; haven&#x27;t seen her in quite a while,
so this is sort of a nice comeback&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;bad&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As often happens, especially with mystery-thrillers, the allure
doesn&#x27;t last beyond the setup. It&#x27;s tiring and repetitive, and the
motives of the villain are unconvincing. The running length should
also have been reduced.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Full of powerful moments and superb acting; a very original story and
desirable gals (especially the newest member of the group). Takes some

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed all the performances, and this was helped by me being a fan of
Deborah Kara Unger (always a pleasure watching this god-damn desirable gal,
though she&#x27;s aging). The lead was nice as well, and his gal gorgeous
beyond words. The story is quite thin, and feels incomplete, but it&#x27;s
real weird that the movie didn&#x27;t get much attention at all.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Sure it&#x27;s a decent offering, with good acting from all the females, but
why did it leave such an impression on so many critics? It was all the
rage years back when it was released, but seeing it again, I actually
wonder. I remember appreciating it much more in the first viewing, and I
don&#x27;t remember why.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that makes it worthy of promotion is it&#x27;s attempt at removing
prejudice against certain people in society (transvestites and
prostitutes), for there isn&#x27;t a single important character in the movie
that finds them distasteful. The dialog is pretty good and the character
of the lead tranvestite delightful, though I&#x27;m not sure about the
quality of the performance.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s well-made and has decent acting, but offers nothing new, with the
lead&#x27;s assholeness levels unbearable, and for far too long. The
boyfriend is given a nice (though not too skilled) performance and so is
the grandpa. The diary visual effects are nice (but I&#x27;ve seen them
elsewhere before). The message the movie offers, compassion, is
delivered quite well, although it&#x27;s made in an unconvincing manner
(it&#x27;s like fantasy).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;If you put a few people in a hole in which they can&#x27;t escape, and
provide only water for a month, what would they do? The movie covers the
concept and quite effectively at that, with the ending, the sort I
normally don&#x27;t like in horror movie, quite satisfying. Oh, they do end
up eating each other. I kept thinking I&#x27;d rather die, but maybe that&#x27;s
becaue I don&#x27;t know the pain of hunger. But screws that, I&#x27;d commit
suicide first. That seems an easier solution.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie is very low-budget and feels like its made by students, but
the acting is quite good. It would have benefited from decent
cinematography.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I hardly ever enjoy romantic comedies because they tend to be cheap
recycled material and this one is no different, except that it&#x27;s
actually funny in many places (highlights are the moments with the
family), and full of good comic performances, most notably the fat guy.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/shelter-2010/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;The movie is full of excellent performances:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Julianne Moore, but has she ever fucked up in her career?&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The lady who lost 3 sons; superb portrayal of grief.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jonathan Rhys Meyers, with a caveat that he plays a character whose
body is used as host by a number of souls (personalities of dead
people), so he doesn&#x27;t always keep up.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cinematography, production, and direction are top-notch. The script
(and dialogue) is quite good as well, until we get beyond roughly an
hour, where, like many movies that start well, the writers don&#x27;t know
where to take the script. That&#x27;s where the explanation of the story
must come in, and maybe it&#x27;s because I find supernatural claims shitty,
but it&#x27;s just not done well. We get offerred standard horror fare,
nothing good enough to justify the whole thing. Fuck, there&#x27;s even a
moment where our heroic psychologist plays action hero. Eish!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;strong&gt;sidenote&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;] Regardless of the shitness, I think the movie received
too little attention from mainstream critics and audience. We must
probably blame the marketing team too.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <pubDate>Sun, 03 Apr 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
                <link>http://tshepang.net/waterworld-1995/</link>
                <guid>http://tshepang.net/waterworld-1995/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s without any decent dialog, but the story makes it fun to watch.
Quite a big budget, and it&#x27;s evident. All those sets. Quite impressive.
I wish there was a better cinematographer to fully exploit them.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of the performances are really good (excluding the guy who was paid
to protect the soon-to-be-destroyed village out hero trades with),
though I enjoyed watching the guy flying the balloon. Check his excited
curiosity when meeting the mutated hero (he can breath under water). The
villains are nothing above cartoonish. Maybe it was so that the movie
was suitable for kids (post-apocalypse isn&#x27;t exactly a light subject).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of soil being the most-valued item on the water-covered
earth (as a result of global warming) is interesting.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Done with the style of &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;crimson-gold-2003&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Crimson Gold&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, it&#x27;s a superbly-made and
-acted movie about the ravages of poverty and the problems associated
with making abortion illegal. The general ill-treatment people give each
other is horrid, but luckily things are lightened up when our hero&#x27;s
boyfriend celebrates mom&#x27;s birthday (even though there&#x27;s a sour note).
And the mom gives quite a good performance (and so does everyone else).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the comparison with &lt;em&gt;Crimson Gold&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, it has far better acting, but
doesn&#x27;t cover as much ground and is therefore simpler. I can&#x27;t decide
which is superior between the two, but &lt;em&gt;Crimson Gold&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; had a stronger
emotional impact on me. Maybe that makes it a better movie.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I was expecting more from this (well-made) crime drama about a boy who
moves in with a criminally violent family following mother&#x27;s death. All
performances are good though.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/antichrist-2009/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;A couple is going through a period of immense pain in their life,
triggered by the death of their toddler. A lot of the imagery is horrid
and bizarre (e.g. there&#x27;s an animal walking around with a stillborn
still attached to pussy), and the movie itself is rather dreamlike, with
the director exercising high levels of freedom.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The twist near the end is quite shocking; the love the man has for the
woman (who is mentally screwed by the loss) is impressive. This woman is
given is really good performance. The dialog is quite good as well. The
title is misleading, and is based on &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Antichrist_(film)#Development&quot;&gt;a removed concept&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; that was in an
earlier script.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;The were moments of good humor (e.g. when lead character was stealing
the shrinking machine), but much of the time, the whole thing is
irritating; the writers worked hard at making this child-friendly (e.g.
being hit multiple missiles results only in a sad face covered in
smoke); the excessivley-advanced gadgets are nice.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;An unbearably-uninteresting and badly-made take on the legend of Dracula
(Gary Oldman), the world&#x27;s first vampire. It&#x27;s rather shocking that it
was made by the great Francis Ford Coppola, and it&#x27;s probably his
worst. A better (character development; acting) vampire can be found in
&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Nosferatu_the_Vampyre&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nosferatu&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (1979). Winona Ryder is quite bad as the vampire&#x27;s
lover, though not as much as Keanu Reeves (who also has a face so
gorgeous).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of the vampire&#x27;s shadow, which defies physics, is rather
interesting.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;There&#x27;s good humor to be had in here, but I expected more. The two
idiotic scifi lovers who help rescue the alien are played by the guys
who appeared in &lt;em&gt;Shaun of the Dead&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, and they are fun to watch, most
especially the short one (he looks like an old woman). The alien they
are rescuing, the title character, is not interesting.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <title>Sex, Lies, and Videotape (1989)</title>
                <pubDate>Thu, 31 Mar 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/sex-lies-and-videotape-1989/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;I have just one piece of memory of this movie, and it&#x27;s of James Spader
sitting naked watching women talk of sex on video. I can&#x27;t recall
anything else, other than that I really found it boring, but that was
back in the 90&#x27;s. I probably didn&#x27;t even watch the whole thing.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways I really loved the movie this time around. The direction is
really amazing, with wonderful performances, especially from &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Andie_MacDowell&quot;&gt;Andie
McDowell&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Not only desirable, but a fuckin&#x27; excellent performance. She
isn&#x27;t a bad actor, but I don&#x27;t remember her shining like this
elsewhere. As for James Spader, I don&#x27;t remember enjoying any of his
performances, until now. Well, not entirely, but I loved his portrayal
of mystery guy in his early scenes. Great character development there.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dialog is excellent, and the story simple, and it feels really
fresh. Quite a feat, considering that it&#x27;s made in the 80&#x27;s (there&#x27;s
hardly anything still fresh from that era).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Horrible horror without much going for it, except that the clown is
quite interesting, given his humorous and sinister character (and
laughter). Why they made the lady so sexually suggestive is strange. Oh,
and the black guy, why do I smell Black activism? The (non)battle with
the giant spider is ludicrous. It&#x27;s one of those things that make it
hard to believe that movie makers always watch their creations before
release. They could have done better with that spider, even in 1990. Oh,
and the whole thing is just left unexplained.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;An early scene, involving the gal cheating on two guys, was very
promising. That our gal was so fine also did help, and is the fact that
the torture was on public display. This made it look like it actually
had a fatter budget, and this got me excited. The only other moment that
was well-done was the torture of the racist, and this is due to it&#x27;s
great production design and casting. The rest of the farce was worn out.
Luckily the movie was more enjoyable than it&#x27;s predecessor, &lt;em&gt;Saw IV&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole premise of the series is actually interesting (though I sure
hope no one would tries to imitate it), and I wish it was limited to the
initial ideology, whereby the victims&#x27; decisions involved only them.
But it seems to the writers that wasn&#x27;t exciting enough, and there was
instead an insistence on having it been done to others too, who were
often innocent (e.g. you go through some horrid torture OR your wife
dies). Sounds like desperate writing to me.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I was surprised to find that this movie was made by the legendary
Francis Ford Coppola. It&#x27;s not quite big and famous either, perhaps due
to its lukewarm story and direction. I&#x27;m however glad that it has these
nice elements:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The enjoyable performance of Danny Glover, who plays the judge in
the case. I don&#x27;t recall enjoying any other of his performances.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The movie&#x27;s best performance is that of Jon Voigt, who plays the
defence lawyer. None of his other performances are as good or as
enjoyable, but my memory has been proven unreliable.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;strong&gt;sidenote&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;] I watched this only cuz I read the book (the version
condensed by Readers&#x27; Digest).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/the-chronicles-of-narnia-the-voyage-of-the-dawn-treader-2010/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;I didn&#x27;t watch the whole of this, the 3rd in the Narnia series. I just
flipped through to ensure I wasn&#x27;t missing anything of worth:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The watery dolphins were likely a homage to my favorite visual
effects work this year, the sea god from &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-chronicles-of-narnia-prince-caspian-2008&quot;&gt;the 2nd Narnia movie&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The lion looked better than on that predecessor, but not necessarily
more realistic.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The water effects near the end of the movie, where it forms a
wall-like effect, are amazing. This is some of the best water work
ever.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My favorite visual effects work is the sea serpent. It&#x27;s an
equivalent of &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Kraken_(Pirates_of_the_Caribbean)&quot;&gt;the Kraken&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man&#x27;s
Chest&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;). As was the case with the sea god, this was an interesting
departure from the series&#x27; obsession with bad character design.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not going to withstand the pain of watching the entire movie
though. I&#x27;ve suffered enough the with two predecessors.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/the-firm-1993/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;A reasonably enjoyable movie that is sadly showing its age. Luckily
there&#x27;s many nice performances:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Holly Hunter: I didn&#x27;t even notice it was her, until I saw the
credits; it&#x27;s been a while I guess; she plays the lover of the
private investigator.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Gary_Busey&quot;&gt;Gary Busey&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;: He&#x27;s fun to watch as private investigator. He gets
some of the movie&#x27;s best dialogue. Also, I don&#x27;t remember enjoying
any of his performances, until now.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ed Harris: This is one good actor, and I only wish he was given
enough great roles, instead of playing second fiddle to lesser
actors like Tom Cruise. The scene where he breaks in anger, where he
reveals the size of his balls to the Tom Cruise character, is solid.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;David Strathairn: The character of the hero&#x27;s brother was rather
misplaced and was given too much importance. It was just not
needed for the story. That however shouldn&#x27;t make us ignore the
fact that it was performed well.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#x27;s a bunch of desirable gals too, not least of which was the great
Holly Hunter herself. Another is the wife, and another (the most
desirable) is the lady who seduced our hero on the beach in what is
easily the silliest moment in the movie.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;strong&gt;sidenote&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;]
Now, this Gary Busy guy is one prolific guy,
with over 120 movie appearances! I think most are shit though, as is
often the case with actors this active. Remember &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Dennis_Hopper_filmography&quot;&gt;Dennis Hopper&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;As so often happens, it baffles me why so many critics &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Chronicles_of_Narnia:_Prince_Caspian#Reception&quot;&gt;found this any
good&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. The only thing worthy of praise is the sea good, who happens to
embody some of the best water effects I&#x27;ve seen yet. Everything else
was just bland (cinematography, costumes, battles, acting, story,
production and creature design, character development), just like the
first movie.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Its concept of mind-controlling parasites is quite interesting, but its
action is not. I watched this forgettable movie a while ago (10+
years?). None of the acting is any good, but at least they got a real
gorgeous gal. The character design of the creatures is quite good, and I
especially like how they shape themselves when transported, before
spreading out their bodies.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;An okay and interesting enough movie about this heroic lady (Julia
Roberts) who plays a key role in a law-suit against a major corporation.
I saw it some years back, and it&#x27;s just forgettable. I don&#x27;t like the
fact that the story about the ex-husbands was so ignored, or even the
character of the angelic boyfriend. They just didn&#x27;t care to justify
why he was so kind, or even cover a little bit of his backgrounds.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Julia Roberts&#x27; performance got a lot of praise, and although it&#x27;s far
from bad, I find it overrated. There&#x27;s nothing spectacular about it.
Maybe these people should just admit that they loved the character she
played. I did too. She is far tougher than I&#x27;ll probably ever be.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Not really interesting, and that&#x27;s not helped by the rather untalented
(or should I say uninteresting?) Matt Damon who plays the title
character who reveals his company&#x27;s price-fixing activities. It drags
and drags, and really paints a bad picture of this informant guy to the
point where you (I) end up hating him. The plot is overly complex, and
the director attempts to keep it light with a comic touch or two, but it
doesnt work. I seriously didn&#x27;t enjoy this, even though I have to admit
that it&#x27;s well-made (direction, sets, camerawork, script).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Slow pacing gives it a feeling of self-importance, and makes it boring,
especially after lethal injection. Having a bad actor as lead doesn&#x27;t
help either. Luckily, the other performances aren&#x27;t so bad, though none
is any spectacular. The twist is rather implausible.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;The story is not interesting enough for this to be a cinema movie,
that&#x27;s why it went straight to tv. I hate watching a movie which makes
me impatient when it&#x27;s going to end. The interesting moments are too
few to make if worth a watch. One notion worth mentioning though is the
idea of sacrifice, that one high-ranking officer knowingly sacrificed an
unusual number of soldiers for the &#x27;greater&#x27; good. It&#x27;s not clear
what the standpoint of the movie is, but I suspect the writer leaned
more towards the brutality being worth it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;strong&gt;sidenote&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;] It would be interesting to know why attaching knives on
rifles stopped becoming fashionable.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;It is better than the annoying &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;recent-movies-2010-10-25&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Book of Eli&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, but not as
interesting. The portrayal of the post-apocalyptic world is as grim as
it gets, and seems far more realistic than &lt;em&gt;Eli&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;i-am-legend&quot;&gt;I Am Legend&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. The
danger they face, where people kill and&#x2F;or eat each other for survival,
gives an edge to the movie as well.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Excessively depressing and disturbing (all the blood and physical harm;
the annoying personality of the lead character; her possessive mom).
Also, like &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;showgirls-1995&quot;&gt;Showgirls&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;all-about-eve-1950&quot;&gt;All About Eve&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; before it, it&#x27;s main theme
is of a fresh stage performer hungry to be at the top, and the harms
resulting from that obsession. At the end, Darren Aronofsky is revealed
to be the director. Not that I would have guessed it, but it wasn&#x27;t
surprising, given the director&#x27;s other movies, &lt;em&gt;Pi&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;requiem-for-a-dream-2000&quot;&gt;Requiem for A
Dream&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, which could hardly be called easy viewing. It&#x27;s very well-made,
but I seriously didn&#x27;t enjoy it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Another Tarantino copycat, perhaps the worst I&#x27;ve seen yet. Michael
Madsen sucks because he does the same performance he always gives (since
&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;recent-movies-2010-10-25&quot;&gt;Reservoir Dogs&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;) and so does Dennis Hopper. The slow pacing is nearly
unbearable, and the smart-ass dialogue is just not as good as Tarantino
can make it. Interestingly, Tarantino lend his name to the movie
(&lt;em&gt;Tarantino presents...&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;). Seems like he&#x27;s not easily embarassed.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Good stuntwork, especially the very first killing, even if it defies the
laws of physics. Should be forgiven because the movie is stylised. Bruce
Willis, the lead character, is interesting to watch in the beginning,
but we quickly get tired of him, especially because the whole thing
feels pointless, with him doing the same expressions, which don&#x27;t lend
any reality to the fantasy. He should have a got a better hairdo too.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Geoffrey Rush, who plays the speech therapist, gives an amazing
performance. He always delivers good performances, but this was perhaps
his best ever. The moment he was sitting on the kings&#x27; chair was
wonderfully humorous.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colin Firth, who plays the title character, did very well too. I don&#x27;t
remember enjoying any of his other work, and this is probably the best
he&#x27;s done yet too. He even got awards for it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Helena Bonham Carter is always a pleasure to watch. Here she plays the
king&#x27;s wife.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The production design is amazing.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie drags a bit, especially for the tiny story it tells.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;pros&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The movie is very well-done and has very interesting characters,
most notably the ever-smiling candidate for mayor position.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The freshness of the direction and cinematography reminds me of the
superior &lt;em&gt;Call Back&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, the best horror I saw for the first time
in 2009.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It covers issues of homosexuality and xenophobia very well.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;cons&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The treatment of the zombie side of things is really shitty. Perhaps
it&#x27;s a lack of a budget, but it&#x27;s done so bad, with bad make-up,
and shitty horror movie happenings.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

doesn&#x27;t work. Being led by an extremely uninteresting Kevin Costner as
title character doesn&#x27;t help.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I had great fun watching this. I can&#x27;t even tell which I enjoyed more
between it and another superb Tim Burton movie, &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;alice-in-wonderland-2010&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alice In
Wonderland&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, nor which is better. The humor, which is solely driven by
the very capable Johnny Depp, is spot-on, while the mightily desirable
Christina Ricci is put there as an excuse for a love interest. The
character design of the headless horseman is wonderful, and so are the
caricatures of the villagers, especially the priest; Tim Burton is
master of caricatures, and I love quality caricatures. His imagery and
atmosphere is also great.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Bizarre sci-fi taking place mostly in a computer system, about an
exciting wish for one computer program to escape into the real world.
There&#x27;s interesting artefacts, like a small rod that transforms into a
vehicle at will, while the simulation of Jeff Bridge&#x27;s face is
disappointing, especiallly considering the great work done to Brad
Pitt&#x27;s face in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;fincher-s-most-pointless-yet&quot;&gt;The Curious Case of Benjamin Button&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, which was
released in 2008. The imagery is very (too) stylish. None of the
performances are worthy of praise (did they have to cast Olivia
Wilde!?).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

were written by one person, because it&#x27;s full of formulaic family
values, and stuff that is so stupid it makes me cringe. Even Emma

                <description>&lt;p&gt;This looks good for a movie so old. I expected some creaky stuff, due to
rotten film stock. Anyways, the title character, a spy, is extremely
uninteresting and is given a very unconvincing performance by Greta
Garbo. Similarly unconvincing and even caricatured is the general she
chills with, and worse still, her soon-to-be-lover.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a one-of-a-kind movie (almost) following a small-time
crook&#x2F;pizza delivery guy (Hussein) on his devoid-of-excitement journey
around some densely-populated city. The guy playing him has a lot of
presence (and he&#x27;s really fun to watch), even though in a typical
Hollywood, he would be reduced to merely a secondary character. The
direction is such that you feel affinity with the main characters, and
they feel as real as any movie can make them.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#x27;s a few wonderful moments in the movie:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The scene where our normally-sad protagonist passes time by giving
pizza away, and he does this to some of his captives. That act
kindness gave me warm and fuzzy feelings.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The scene where our protagonist delivers pizza to a rich guy, who
invites him to stay and enjoy the pizza with him. The motivation is
that he needed to vent a bit and needed some ears for that.
Hussein&#x27;s unwillingness reminded me of the Travis Bickle (Robert De
Niro) in the classic scene of &lt;em&gt;Taxi Driver&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, where one passenger
talks about the pain of a cheating wife... well except that rich
man&#x27;s pain isn&#x27;t quite as intense. The scene also serves to show
the heavy contrast between the worlds of the rich and the poor (and
you should compare rich man&#x27;s place with Hussein&#x27;s; it&#x27;s
ridiculous how the world came to be like this).&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though almost nothing happens (at least as compared to normal
Hollywood fare), the movie also covers the issue of sexual oppression,
but very skillfully and subtly, and in more than one occassion. It made
me appreciate some of the pleasures we have here in South Africa.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The style of this movie is very similar to that of &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Abbas_Kiarostami&quot;&gt;Abbas Kiarostami&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
(&lt;em&gt;A Taste of Cherry&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Wind Will Carry Us&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;), and that&#x27;s not
strange since he wrote the screenplay, and is considered by the director
as his mentor. Most notable, it&#x27;s far better than those two boring
pieces.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sidenotes&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jonathan Rosenbaum, the best movie critic I&#x27;ve read, has a &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jonathanrosenbaum.com&#x2F;?p=6061&quot;&gt;superb
and highly-detailed review&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. He&#x27;s also the one that inspired me to
watch the movie for he is a huge fan of it, to the point of labeling
it a masterpice.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&#x27;ve compared this to &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;4-months-3-weeks-and-2-days-2007&quot;&gt;4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, which is made
in a similar style.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Pretty much enjoyable, with good dialogue, and a fun performance from
1900&#x27;s stepfather, and a lovely love interest, but what an oddball kind
of story? It&#x27;s like some sort of fantasy, and has a weird and
unconvincing competitor, and it&#x27;s as if the faster you can play piano,
the superior you are considered to be. It&#x27;s a pointless story, and I
don&#x27;t know why anyone who write it. Such a strange thing.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Maybe the worst vampire movie I&#x27;ll ever see, in a genre that doesn&#x27;t

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I just found out that this is a sequel. It&#x27;s a feel-good fantasy, made
for kids, with some decent moral lessons. Well, there&#x27;s also some shit
about &amp;quot;it&#x27;s okay to determine reality with your bones&amp;quot; bullshit. Not
good. Emma Thompson is always great to watch, even when under heavy
make-up. The encounter between the two boys and the father who is a
senior in the military was quite powerful.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Had it not been for the misleading title (I thought it had something

                <description>&lt;p&gt;A faity-tale of a story with plenty of holes, but is a whole lot of fun.
I hardly ever enjoy Kurt Russel&#x27;s performances, but this one was far
more bearable. Stallone has always been charismatic on screen, and the
gal playing her sister is ultra-gorgeous (though very unconvincing).
Some of the bad guys are mere comic relief (check the guy with massive
jaws; check they guy with a pony-tail, the one who looks constipated).
Good ole cheap action-comedy.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;An especially shocking first scene got me excited, and whatever happened
afterwards didn&#x27;t justify it&#x27;s magnificence. It has some really good
direction (very dark with high suspense; wonderful romance), acting, and
dialogue, but the ending is shiite. There was a need for a bigger
budget, as evidenced by the less-than-adequate production design. There
was also a need for a better plot; the story about the burning building
is just not enough, and the great jealousy of scarface is just juvenile.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;This is some oddball comedy, with highly-skilled direction, comic
acting, production design and camerawork. It has nice parodies of common
movie elements, but it gets tiring once it&#x27;s clear that the writers
don&#x27;t have any story tell actually; it&#x27;s fun initially, but it
doesn&#x27;t go anywhere as it &#x27;progresses&#x27;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Someone might feel a need to slap me on my wrist, but I&#x27;m seriuosly not
a fan of romantic comedies&#x2F;chick flicks (I&#x27;m not the target market,
duh!). I&#x27;ve never been much interested in the tv show in which this is
based for similar reasons. But I relented, and in turn got punished by
2hr+ of age-old formula that made me hate the genre in the first place.
Regarding the story, the musings regarding sexual&#x2F;romantic relationships
are quite sickening (think &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;eat-pray-love-2010&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eat Pray Love&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;pros&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the first scene is classic&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;decent acting (my fave is hose salesperson)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pretty ladies (my fave is hose salesperson, and the son&#x27;s
girlfriend)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;nice cinematography (the atmosphere fits the subject matter)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;cons&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;just another murder thriller, adding nothing new to the genre, and
with a shitty story; the writers just didn&#x27;t know what to do with
the killer&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-stepfather-1987&quot;&gt;The earlier movie&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is much better.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I thought that the critics would be with me with this for being not
great, but [they actually liked it]. That&#x27;s strange for I didn&#x27;t see
anything worthy in it. In fact there&#x27;s some stupid things: there were
cars parked right next to where the attempted derailment was; some train
driver manages to keep the speed of the train super-humanly constant,
when driving in reverse. More annoying is the subplot regarding the
conductor&#x27;s troubled marriage, which is maybe as bad as Denzel
Washington&#x27;s uninteresting performance. The guy is just plain
overrated, and always plays himself (instead of seeing the character he
plays, I see him playing the character).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was also no character development. If you are not going to bother
creating decent characters, at least try make them interesting. Well, at
least the daughters of Denzel are pretty, but they are nothing other
than filler material. They tried make them interesting by having them
work at a strip-club though, which reminded me of Will Smith&#x27;s stripper
gal in &lt;em&gt;Independence Day&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. None of these served the story in any way, so
it&#x27;s a strange distraction in my eyes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Although there&#x27;s some interesting-enough stuff going on, helped much by
a quality performance by an immeasurably gorgeous leading lady, it just
feels like... there isn&#x27;t anything remarkable.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sidenotes&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jonathan Rosenbaum has an &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jonathanrosenbaum.com&#x2F;?p=5780&quot;&gt;interesting comparison&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;schindler-s-list-1993&quot;&gt;Schindler&#x27;s
List&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, citing &lt;em&gt;Black Book&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; to be morally more complex, and therefore
less escapist.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The mention of the movie &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;mata-hari-1931&quot;&gt;Mata Hari&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; inspired me to watch it.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Here&#x27;s what I wrote over 3 years ago:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with superb-handling and wonderful acting, it lacks intrigue (bar
the memorable scene where the femme fatale gets uncomfortable
treatment), so I&#x27;m only left with great cinematography and excellent
sound.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;d like to take away the &amp;quot;it lacks intrigue&amp;quot; part. It&#x27;s more
accurate to say it&#x27;s not intriguing enough. That&#x27;s because it was fun
watching the planning, buying info, and even the executions themselves.
Also, I choose just two performances as outstanding (Geoffrey Rush and
Daniel Craig); Eric Bana (playing the lead character) isn&#x27;t interesting
enough to be alone on screen. The movie gets dull after that femme
fatale incident due to the slower pacing. As realistic as the story
feels, the info salesmen were rather romanticised. I found the aging
leader, papa, a mere caricature. Not fresh.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I found this one really unbearable and boring. There is decent acting,
but Julia Roberts is extremely uninteresting as a leading lady (I&#x27;ve
never enjoyed any of her performances). The story makes me curious if
the writers believe in the shit they are promoting (prayer; fortune
telling). On the bright side, the experiences in Italy were kinda fun,
and I felt longing for the warmth of the relationships created there.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/mandingo-1975/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;I remember watching this one quite long ago, perhaps less than the age
of ten. It was heavily entrenched in my mind due to its powerful imagery
(full-frontal nudity; sex; beatings). That was porn for me, at the age
when I wasn&#x27;t exposed to much. Revisiting it after all these years is
quite an experience. The imagery is still arresting, and the story
powerful. Oh, and there&#x27;s some hot and happening gals within.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;pros&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The theme of extreme oppression, both of women and of black people,
is very well done&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decent production design&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decent acting&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The lady playing the jealous wife is amazing, both her performance
and her desirability levels&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It feels realistic (as if I know!)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did u see the first gal the young slave-master screwed!&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Young slave-master&#x27;s regular black fuck (I thought it was Angela
Bassett) was pretty too, though rather skinny&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;cons&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ummm... is there any?&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One interesting thing is that the plight of the the jealous wife
saddened me more than that of the slaves. I don&#x27;t know if this was
deliberate by the writer or director, but I cared more for her than for
the slaves, even though they got even shittier treatment.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

two live-action movies (father is still alive; some sprinkling of
supernatural stuff; Pepper is much older, Tony Stark is boring, ....).
It was a fun watch too, other than that the story is pretty much
shallow, and offers nothing fresh.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

so; it was so horrid that when hubby retaliated physically, it felt
like justice (and this is from someone who can&#x27;t bear the thought

                <description>&lt;p&gt;This displeasing movie is so ridiculous that it would have been salvaged
by having the twist being that the guy was just hallucinating all the
time, especially since it was hinted that house arrest makes people go
crazy. Fuck, what&#x27;s up with the supposedly hot gal? What the hell was
the respectable Carrie-Anne Moss doing here?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a movie adaption of a &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Picture_of_Dorian_Gray&quot;&gt;novel&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; that had a rather interesting
concept: a painting is made of a pretty man, and instead of him getting
injured or aging, it&#x27;s the image of the painting that does. It&#x27;s fun
watching the title character&#x27;s deeds, though he sometimes does it at
the expense of the innocent. The negative influence his &#x27;mentor&#x27; has
on him is annoying, and worse still, the &#x27;mentor&#x27; complains when his
fuckin&#x27; daughter falls for Dorian - hypocrisy.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a weird one, with a silly title, and nice visual effects, and a
desirable gal in the form of the title character&#x27;s love interest. The
script is really stupid (e.g. one woman withstands the abuses of a
smelly man in order to keep her son safe, since the smell can hide the
son&#x27;s scent!) and the end empty like a mothafucka. They just sit there,
without dialog? So, so strange that you spend millions on technical
wizardry, but neglect to spend enough time developing the story.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Oriental fantasy is my kinda movie genre. The characters in this one are
as colorful as a peace-loving man effortlessly killing over a dozen
ninjas, or a super-sweet doll who happens to be among the top warriors
in the village. The story is rather silly, where self-sacrifice is the
order of the day. It&#x27;s edgy at the same time, but is too poetic for my
liking (think &lt;em&gt;Hero&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;) and there&#x27;s
isn&#x27;t enough of great martial arts choreography.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I don&#x27;t know if we were to take this as comic farce or serious fantasy
drama, but it turned out too eccentric and unfocused. Luckily it got
great cinematography.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could not help but notice the physical resemblance between Max von
Sydow (lead character) and Hugh Laurie of &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;House_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;House&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;) fame.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Nice visual effects (check the suits) help rescue the shitty and
formulaic movie. The action is rather too loud, but the Paris chase
sequence deserves praise. I wish a better lead actor was chosen; I wish
there wasn&#x27;t no past romantic connection with him and the lady; I wish
there wan&#x27;t no past connection between the two best fighters: the
villainous one and the silent one. These are all badly-handled.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I love stories about genius, but this one is as depressing as fuck.
Also, it&#x27;s &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Good_Will_Hunting#Reception&quot;&gt;waaay overrated&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. The one character that tries make it
colorful is Minnie Driver&#x27;s (the girlfriend), but like everyone else,
she isn&#x27;t convincing. She was designed to be super-cool, but it looks
fake and cheap, like a character I would create.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;This one is typical of those unbearable age-old Hollywood movies. It&#x27;s
&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Sunset_Boulevard_(film)#Stature&quot;&gt;overrated&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; as hell, and I&#x27;m now curious what it&#x27;s appeal was.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;pros&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He may be a caricature, but the butler is interesting to watch.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The wannabe writer is so wantable, and so is her friend.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Shitty storyline.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unconvincing scenarios.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I expected this sequel to be junk, but was pleasantly surprised to find
it was about as exciting as the first, and perhaps funnier, and with
richer content.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;pros&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Grim Reaper was great fun to watch; one of the highlights was
him challenging the duo, who were playing for their freedom from
hell.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It was fun to watch the evil Bill &amp;amp; Ted.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;cons&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The novelty of freshness went away.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keanu Reeves still sucks.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The genius scientist could have been more fun, and their melding
seemed to serve no purpose.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I miss the splattering of comic one-liners that the original had.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I haven&#x27;t seen this one probably in over ten years, and I remember
enjoying excellently well, much like now. Of course it&#x27;s a popcorn,
laid-back comedy, but it&#x27;s amazingly entertaining.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;pros&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The few heavy-duty words found on many of the movie&#x27;s lines adds to
great comic effect.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A truly fun performance by the guy playing Bill.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The effort that went into designing the worlds of the historical
characters, their constumes, and their character design is
impressive, especially for a movie of this nature.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;cons&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keany Reeves was as bad as he is today. Damn, what a let-down.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Well, the visual effects should not count, since the movie is like
ancient&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An extremely shallow story&#x2F;plot.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The honorable Abraham Lincoln should have been given something to
say.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I only watched this one because it was said to be an inspiration
(ripped-off) for the underrated &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;showgirls-1995&quot;&gt;Showgirls&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, and it certainly is. So
much of the story crept through (young and ambitious blood taking over
from the established; lawyers of the established getting involved; much
conniving involved in the process; etc). Luckily I did enjoy this one
throughout, which is quite a rare thing for a movie so old. But, the
movie is waaay &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;All_About_Eve#Critical_reaction&quot;&gt;overrated&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. WTF!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;pros&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;gorgeous gals: Marilyn Monroe playing a small part of a young gal
trying to make it as an actor and Bette Davis playing the
established actor&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;nice dialogue here and there&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;cons&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;shitty (unconvincing) performance by the gal playing the title
character, Eve&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;another shitty performance by the gal who introduces Eve to the
established&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;stagey direction, as is common with movies this old; and we are
supposed to take these characters seriously?&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I haven&#x27;t seen this one probably in over ten years, and it&#x27;s not quite
as good as I remember. I even found the performances rather lacking and
that includes Liam Neeson&#x27;s title character. I&#x27;m a fan of the guy, but
what he does here is almost embarassing, and he&#x27;s far outdone by the
movie&#x27;s best performer, Ralph Fiennes (the villain). One other
notably-bad performance is that of the lady playing the Jewish love
interest of our villain. Ben Kingsley, who plays the accountant, is as
uninteresting as usual. Nothing else stands out, although it was fun to
watch the cartoonish portrayal of the guy making a hinge.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, the movie is bearable throughout it&#x27;s entire 180+ min running
time. Also, stories of heroism are ever so appealing.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comparison with other movies set around the Holocaust:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sophie&#x27;s Choice&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; did a better job, even though the coverage of the
subject material was very brief.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Life is Beautiful&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; offered a far more moving experience, even
though it was partly a comedy.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s amazing that one can take a silly idea, and make a decent movie of
it. I&#x27;m not sure what the point was, but the some powerful moments, and
decent acting. My favorites were the physicist&#x27;s turn in the court, but
better still was the rabbi, whose encyclopedic knowledge of the Old
Testament made his argument all the more moving. Stellan Skarsgård, who
plays the judge, is as great as usual.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Good quality but stale tale of forbidden romance. It has decent acting
throughout, especially from Alba Rohrwacher, who plays the lesbian
daughter. Tilda Swinton is quite good too, except that she overdows her
role a little too much (e.g. her restlessness is over-the-top). This
makes her portrayal rather unbelievable, even though she is a pleasure
to watch (as usual).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Back then when I saw it for the first time, I was excessively impressed
with it, which made it hard to comprehend why the heck it got such &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Showgirls#Reception&quot;&gt;low
ratings&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. If we remove &#x27;excessively&#x27;, that&#x27;s still the case. It&#x27;s
got good performances and a very fitting lead role. It&#x27;s very energetic
and intense, but it&#x27;s too full of frantic, over-the-top acts (the
near-accident caused by the guy offering a lift, the first meeting with
sweet gal, the lap dance, ...), which are rather disturbing, divorcing
the movie from reality. The brutality shown at the end wasn&#x27;t needed,
and is neither explanied nor justified. The movie remains excellent.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <title>(500) Days of Summer (2009)</title>

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Tries so hard to be fresh, and although its back-and-forth is unique, it
doesn&#x27;t rescue the movie from being yet-another-romantic-drama. It&#x27;s
ineffective, and there&#x27;s nothing refreshing, and it&#x27;s attempt at
trying to make it different makes it unbearable. I was surprised that it
got such &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;(500)_Days_of_Summer#Critical_reception&quot;&gt;good ratings&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One fresh concept I gotta applaud is the Expectations&#x2F;Reality thing,
where two scenes are put side-by-side, one real and one not.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I don&#x27;t recall ever seeing such extreme loyalty and devotion to a
living figure as the people surrounding Adolf Hitler in this grim
portrayal of his final hours. It goes beyond irrational, and into insane
territory.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excellent movie by the way (acting, direction, writing). The portrayal
of Hitler&#x27;s moments of outrage are classic, one of which has been

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/dark-matter-2007/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;The story is quite original: our hero is a boy genius and the villain is
a professor he assists, who proves to be a hypocrite averse to being
challenged.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is Meryl Streep doing here by the way? I mean her character? She
does add sweetness to the otherwise dull movie though.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;The movie has three parts: the first got me excited due to superb
direction and nice storytelling; the 2nd doesn&#x27;t lose superb direction
but gets tedious; the 3rd makes me wonder why the writers bothered, but
luckily has one desirable gal, the one with a rare blood type.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole thing turns out pointless (and stupid) at the end.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;production design; check the home of the father (Michael Douglas)
and the office of the billionaire (Josh Brolin)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cinematography; the best moments are near the end&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Susan Sarandon is both beautiful and lovely&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;cons&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;feels like a desperate attempt to live off the shine of the 80&#x27;s
(overrated) original&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the slow pacing and stale direction made me go &amp;quot;when does it end?&amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the story is stale&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the lead actor is miscast, and exposes his lack of talent&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/2010-movie-review/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;best movie&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; I have seen this year is
&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;somewhere-2010&quot;&gt;Somewhere&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. The year&#x27;s &lt;strong&gt;greatest spectacle&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;, however, is
&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;many-many-recent-movies&quot;&gt;Inception&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, followed by &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;recent-movies-2010-09-15&quot;&gt;The A-Team&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. The best &lt;strong&gt;direction&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is
a tie between &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;many-many-recent-movies&quot;&gt;Brooklyn&#x27;s Finest&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
and &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;somewhere-2010&quot;&gt;Somewhere&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;visuals&quot;&gt;visuals&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best &lt;strong&gt;cinematography&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; can be seen in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;recent-movies-2010-05-06&quot;&gt;An Education&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, followed by
&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-social-network-2010&quot;&gt;The Social Network&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. The best &lt;strong&gt;visual effects&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; can be seen in
&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;many-many-recent-movies&quot;&gt;Inception&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and the best &lt;strong&gt;production design&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; can be seen in &lt;em&gt;Death At
A Funeral&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;... the interior of that home is wonderful. The best
&lt;strong&gt;editing&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; can be seen in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;many-many-recent-movies&quot;&gt;The Kite Runner&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. The best
&lt;strong&gt;opening credits sequence&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is in &lt;em&gt;Up in the Air&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, followed by &lt;em&gt;An
Education&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;miscellaneous&quot;&gt;miscellaneous&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best &lt;strong&gt;adventure&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; movie is &lt;em&gt;Prince of Persia&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, the best &lt;strong&gt;horror&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;,
&lt;em&gt;Call Back&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, and the most &lt;strong&gt;painful&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is &lt;em&gt;The
Magdalene Sisters&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. The &lt;strong&gt;funniest&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is &lt;em&gt;Get Smart&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, and most
&lt;strong&gt;enchanting&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is &lt;em&gt;Alice In Wonderland&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. The best &lt;strong&gt;action direction&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;
is in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;many-many-recent-movies&quot;&gt;Takers&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best &lt;strong&gt;script&#x2F;dialogue&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;memento-2000&quot;&gt;Memento&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
followed by &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-social-network-2010&quot;&gt;The Social Network&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. The best &lt;strong&gt;narration&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; can be found in
the most &lt;strong&gt;bizarre&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; movie of the year, &lt;em&gt;Sita Sings the Blues&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. There
was nothing more &lt;strong&gt;moody&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; than &lt;em&gt;Anamorph&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best &lt;strong&gt;sound&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is a tie between &lt;em&gt;Up in the Air&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;somewhere-2010&quot;&gt;Somewhere&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;acting-characters&quot;&gt;acting &amp;amp; characters&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were so many enjoyable performances this year that I couln&#x27;t
clearly decide who was better than who, and here&#x27;s an attempt:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The year&#x27;s most &lt;strong&gt;favorite performance&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is that of Jesse Eisenberg in
(&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-social-network-2010&quot;&gt;The Social Network&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;), followed by:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a tie between Stanley Tucci &amp;amp; Patricia Clarkson (&lt;em&gt;Easy A&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ron Perlman (&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;recent-movies-2010-11-19&quot;&gt;The Job&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;homo guy (&lt;em&gt;Woman On Top&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;); John Cleese (&lt;em&gt;Spud&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;); friend (&lt;em&gt;Lottery
Ticket&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the category of &lt;strong&gt;best male performance&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;, Guy Pearce (&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;memento-2000&quot;&gt;Memento&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;)
ties with Woody Harrelson (&lt;em&gt;The Messenger&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for &lt;strong&gt;best female performance&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;,
we have Meryl Streep in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;recent-movies-2010-11-19&quot;&gt;Sophie&#x27;s Choice&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
followed by Carrie-Anne Moss in
&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;memento-2000&quot;&gt;Memento&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, her best performance so far.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My most &lt;strong&gt;favorite character&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is the admirable Nelson Mandela (played
by Morgan Freeman) in (&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;recent-movies-2010-11-19&quot;&gt;Invictus&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;). Runner-up is Rosalind
Pike&#x27;s superbly gorgeous but dumb-ass blonde in (&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;recent-movies-2010-05-06&quot;&gt;An Education&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;best child performance&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; was by the girl palying the daughter in
(&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;somewhere-2010&quot;&gt;Somewhere&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;), followed by title character in &lt;em&gt;Spud&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best &lt;strong&gt;cast&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; that of &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;recent-movies-2010-05-06&quot;&gt;An Education&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, followed by that of &lt;em&gt;Calendar
Girls&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best &lt;strong&gt;cast of children&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; can be found in &lt;em&gt;Spud&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, while the year&#x27;s
best &lt;strong&gt;villain&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is that played of Hades in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;clash-of-the-titans-2010&quot;&gt;Clash of the Titans&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
(also the year&#x27;s most fearsome character),
followed by the tough and smart shooter in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;recent-movies-2010-09-15&quot;&gt;The A-Team&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most &lt;strong&gt;desirable gal&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; list follows:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vera Farmiga (Up in the Air) and Lois character
(&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;many-many-recent-movies&quot;&gt;Superman&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lover (Last Tango in Paris); Maggie Gyllenhaal (&lt;em&gt;Crazy Heart&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bride (&lt;em&gt;Mamma Mia&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;); huge eyes (&lt;em&gt;Outsourced&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;police lady (&lt;em&gt;Holy Water&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most &lt;strong&gt;miserable character&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; was that of Philip Seymour Hoffman in
&lt;em&gt;Synecdoche, New York&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, which isn&#x27;t very surpsring since such
characters are his trademark. He&#x27;s followed very closely by Marlon
Brando&#x27;s in the disturbing &lt;em&gt;Last Tango in Paris&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best &lt;strong&gt;character design&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is the bizarre cyborg trio in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;afro-samurai-resurrection-2009&quot;&gt;Afro
Samurai: Resurrection&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, followed by Hades, the villain in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;clash-of-the-titans-2010&quot;&gt;Clash of the
Titans&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most &lt;strong&gt;charming character&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is the cat in &lt;em&gt;Secret of Kells&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. Also,
its eyes reminds me too much of a gal I intensely obsessed over some
years ago.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most &lt;strong&gt;perfect gentleman&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is hubby to Julia (&lt;em&gt;Julie &amp;amp; Julia&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;),
played by Stanley Tucci. Runner-up is the oh-so-perfect groom character
in &lt;em&gt;Our Family Wedding&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;koolest guy&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is Mark Wahlberg&#x27;s in &lt;em&gt;Date Night&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, followed by
Justin Timberlake&#x27;s in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-social-network-2010&quot;&gt;The Social Network&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best character development ever for a &lt;strong&gt;nerd&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; can be found in
&lt;em&gt;Shopgirl&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, in a form of an inept lover. As for this year, this is
followed by the schoolboy in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;recent-movies-2010-05-06&quot;&gt;An Education&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. As is so common, both
character&#x27;s shortcomings involve girls.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#x27;s a list of most &lt;strong&gt;painful&#x2F;touching scene&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;strapped with bombs (&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;recent-movies-2010-05-06&quot;&gt;The Hurt Locker&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;death by insulin (&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;memento-2000&quot;&gt;Memento&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hate for a dead wife (&lt;em&gt;Last Tango in Paris&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;) -- leads one
sympathising with the otherwise unpleasant character&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;expression of love between cop and prostitute (&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;many-many-recent-movies&quot;&gt;Brooklyn&#x27;s
Finest&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best &lt;strong&gt;dance scene&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is the dark, yet enchanting puppet mastery
sequence in &lt;em&gt;Chicago&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. The best &lt;strong&gt;sci-fi set&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is the white ship
interior in &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil Afterlife&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, the best &lt;strong&gt;warfare&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is in
&lt;em&gt;Centurion&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, the best &lt;strong&gt;story concept&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;memento-2000&quot;&gt;Memento&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, followed by
&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;many-many-recent-movies&quot;&gt;Inception&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each repeat of a movie is a different experience, hence this category of
&lt;strong&gt;best first-time viewing experience&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. This year, it is won by &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;iron-man-2&quot;&gt;Iron
Man 2&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, which failed on the rewatch value department.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;old-movies&quot;&gt;&#x27;old&#x27; movies&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section is meant to give a chance to movies I have watched before
this year to appear in this review, for one reason or another.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of those, the &lt;strong&gt;best experience&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; was offered by &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;smokin-aces-2006&quot;&gt;Smokin&#x27; Aces&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, which
has now been elevated to a masterpiece. Runner-up is &lt;em&gt;Reservoir Dogs&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;,
which remains fresh and exciting after all these years... a rare
quality for a movie indeed.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;fall from glory&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; award goes to:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most &lt;strong&gt;boring&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; movie this year is &lt;em&gt;A Brighter Summer Day&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, followed
by &lt;em&gt;Afterwards&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; (no pun intended). The most &lt;strong&gt;overrated&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; movie is
&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;many-many-recent-movies&quot;&gt;Shane&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (dull and lame), followed by &lt;em&gt;Up&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, which doesn&#x27;t
live anywhere near the high expectations worthy of animated movies of
its stature. The most &lt;strong&gt;overrated villain&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is Jack Nicholson as The
Joker in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;many-many-recent-movies&quot;&gt;Batman&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. WTF!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <title>Bamboozled (2000)</title>
                <pubDate>Fri, 31 Dec 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I last watched &lt;em&gt;Bamboozled&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; perhaps a decade ago, and I&#x27;m glad to say
that it seems even better than the first viewing, bar the intensity of
the climax (some things work better the first time). Spike Lee&#x27;s
direction is amazing (rough and unpolished, just like &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;baise-moi-2000&quot;&gt;Baise-moi&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;). This
is the best acting role I&#x27;ve seen by the not-too-talented Damon Wayans
as the lead character, Jada Pinkett is sweet to the eye as his &lt;em&gt;help&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;,
Mos Def is real fun as a shit-for-brains gangster, but the movie&#x27;s only
really good peformance is that of Michael Rapaport, who plays the TV
executive. Shit, this niggah is (nearly) worth the entire movie itself,
and is so &lt;strong&gt;real&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <pubDate>Fri, 31 Dec 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
                <link>http://tshepang.net/many-many-recent-movies/</link>
                <guid>http://tshepang.net/many-many-recent-movies/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A break from work meant that much of the previous few weeks were spent
glued to my laptop screen, enjoying the wonderful art world of movies.
Another inspiration is preparation for the upcoming 2010 movie review.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jack Nicholson&#x27;s The Joker (&lt;em&gt;Batman&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;) has been given much praise, and
on revisiting, I&#x27;m left wondering what the fuck they were
drinking&#x2F;smoking. Sure, this version of the character was meant to be
humorous, but it&#x27;s hard to ignore how far he pales in comparison to the
Heath Ledger&#x27;s more recent portrayal.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was gladly surprised by how enjoyable &lt;em&gt;Superman&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is. It&#x27;s generally a
piece of shit (bad and childish dialogue, campy direction, shitty
character development, bad script) but I fell in love with Lois, the
love interest of Superman. She&#x27;s is so god-damn sexually suggestive
(highlight is the interview scene). The comic sidekick of Lex Luther
(archvillain) is also fun to watch, sometimes. The guy playing Superman
in his teens is pretty good too, making for a better actor the
fully-grown Superman. And the time-reversal moment is ludicrous. WTF! As
a sidenote, it was interesting to find that &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Superman_(film)&quot;&gt;the movie&#x27;s director got
someone to re-write the script due to it being too campy&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Superman II&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; had some (very) unbearably stupid moments, but it was fun
watching the evil trio exploring the world, especially the inquisitive
woman, and the power-hungry general. The whole was even campier than the
first movie, and the script is pure trash, more of a curiosity than
something to be taken seriusly.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really love the editing of &lt;em&gt;The Kite Runner&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, and how smooth the
camera switches from one view&#x2F;scene to another. The movie itself is an
excellent epic, full of profound&#x2F;touching&#x2F;painful moments. The point of
it all, however, escapes me. Sure it exposes the darkness that is
oppression (sexual, economic, military, racial), while also portraying
moments of heroism, but the main idea was lost to me. One other thing
is, if one accepts the movie as some form of (very mild) fantasy, it
makes a few of the movie&#x27;s moments easier to swallow (e.g. the servant
boy is rather too courageous, and his admirable character is stuff of
fairy tales).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The free-spirited, laid-back parents of the lead character of &lt;em&gt;Easy A&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
are given superb performances by Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson.
Lisa Kudrow also lends a notable performance, playing a troubled
guidance teacher. The movie itself is quite well-made, especially
considering that it&#x27;s a teen romantic comedy. The end is unfortunately
shitty, as is usual of the genre.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found a revisit of &lt;em&gt;Inception&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; terribly disturbing, a fact not helped
by excessive violence and intense emotion (the wife thing). The main
concept is very attrative, and the idea of shifting gravity was
well-executed (see the battle on the hallway). The conman is given a
wonderful performance.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Legends&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is a collection of animated short films set in the Halo
universe (equivalent of The Animatrix). I was not going to mention it
here, until I got massively impressed by the superb action direction on
it&#x27;s last short, &lt;em&gt;The Package&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. It&#x27;s intense and well-animated, and
what makes it even nicer is that all participants are the heroic,
hyper-powered Spartans. Rocks! As a sidenote, I spent an untold number
of hours playing and loving the game series, most especially &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Halo:_Combat_Evolved&quot;&gt;the first
one&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;... among the most significant of gaming experiences in my life.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Life is Beautiful&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; helped me shed a few tears, due to the touching
efforts of a man creating a make-believe world for his son, with whom
he&#x27;s imprisoned in a Nazi concentration camp. It&#x27;s a beautiful
fantasy, and is driven very well by Roberto Benigni (both the movie&#x27;s
director and the father character), as well as the boy playing the son.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Human Nature&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; has moments which make me wanna call it a masterpiece,
but it loses steam along the way. Patricia Arquette makes me wanna fuck
a hairy woman, and the ape boy is given a very entertaining performance.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another movie that runs out of steam, though rather too soon, and also
becomes unbearably dull and lame is &lt;em&gt;Shane&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; (1953), which I watched only
because I once read the novel it&#x27;s based on some time ago. It&#x27;s too
rare to have movies this old satisfying. Luckily, the beginning was warm
and charming.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Centurion&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; has excellent battle direction, but screwed up by plot holes
and under-developed female leads (the unconvincing tracker and the
too-convenient caretaking love interest).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gritty, decent action is offset by some real bad casting in the stale
&lt;em&gt;Takers&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. Far superior, and one of the best movies I&#x27;ve seen this year
is &lt;em&gt;Brookly&#x27;s Finest&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, an edgy thriller that more than makes up for
it&#x27;s lack of originality with superb execution and nice acting. The
ending would be even better if the fates of the three lead characters
were treated consistently. It seems to me that someone fucked with the
original story. One favorite moment of mine is the brief but powerful
relationship between our suicidal cop and the (god-damn-gorgeous)
prostitute. Nearly made me drop a tear. This cop&#x27;s my hero for treating
her like that... his queen.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pistol Opera&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; was rather too experimental for my liking. It&#x27;s
excessively unconventional style was rather unbearable, and is barely
helped by the attractive storyline of pretty assassin who kills without
flinching.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s amazing how little (none) chemistry exists between the 4 lead
characters of &lt;em&gt;A-Team&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. Liam Neeson and the agent lady are badly
miscast; the guy plating B-A lacks the charisma that Mr T. had in the TV
series, even if he&#x27;s a better actor.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;...phew!&amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <title>Somewhere (2010)</title>

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/somewhere-2010/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;The lead character of rich, famous, and easily fucks ultra-hot gals, yet
the only bright thing in his life seems to be her beloved daughter (who
is given a flawless portrayal). This feeling of purposelessness is
well-punctuated by Sofia Coppola&#x27;s superb direction of loong takes and
a story where nealy nothing happens. This movie is a greater favorite to
the director&#x27;s earlier &lt;em&gt;Lost in Translation&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, which covered similar
territory; the lead is far more interesting, and does not have that
irritating Japanese tv host.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/recent-movies-2010-11-30/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Although there&#x27;s nothing new, &lt;em&gt;Our Family Wedding&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is such a delight,
and nearly all characters are beautiful, but most especially the 2
fathers (superb acting), and their childish exploits. The thing is
spoilt by some shitty comic touches here and there, especially the goat
thing.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed the highly-underrated &lt;em&gt;The Lottery Ticket&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;; it&#x27;s very
well-made and funny, except it was rather too stagey with a miscast
performance of Ice Cube. Of special note was the guy playing Bow Wow&#x27;s
friend. I could see the appeal the first moment he showed up on screen.
Look out for the scene on the roof where both the guys shine.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Last Action Hero&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is annoying partly because it uses the same movie
formula that it ridicules, though not as heavily as spoofs tend to.
It&#x27;s also annoying because, amidst the noise, it has 2 superb villains,
the glass eye, and the child killer. I loved them back over a decade
ago, and still love them now, so much that I wish their characters
(extremely well done) could be exploited a little more, and in a better
movie. Slater&#x27;s daughter is beloved.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;m sucker for tough gals in movies (as opposed to those who act tough)
and one recent such character is Carrie-Anne Moss&#x27; FBI agent in
&lt;em&gt;Unthinkable&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, a well-made movie spoilt by underdeveloped characters,
most notably Samuel L. Jackson&#x27;s. And I love the ending. I actually
screamed excitement at the end.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <pubDate>Fri, 19 Nov 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
                <link>http://tshepang.net/recent-movies-2010-11-19/</link>
                <guid>http://tshepang.net/recent-movies-2010-11-19/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;There are 2 main stories in &lt;em&gt;Sophie&#x27;s Choice&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, one a fun-filled&#x2F;stormy
relationship between 3 people, and the other, a horrid tale of the title
character&#x27;s experiences in a Nazi concentration camp. Both are
well-made, and Kevin Kline&#x27;s performance is amazing, and Meryl
Streep&#x27;s, even better. Did I mention that the Nazi section is a great
contender for the best ever portrayal of that part of human history
It&#x27;s intense as hell, and Meryl Streep is so fuckin&#x27; amazing as the
victim.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Job&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is superly-made but falls apart beyond halfway through, as if
the writer didn&#x27;t know where to run with the script. The lead character
is quite admirable, the romance wonderful, and the performance of the
immensely ugly Ron Perlman very memorable, as the guy from out-of-town.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&#x27;t think much of &lt;em&gt;Invictus&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, and watching it was just a matter of
curiosity, so I was quite surprised by its quality, and by the time the
final credits sequence rolled, I thought &amp;quot;No wonder the movie is so
good! The director is Clint Eastwood for God&#x27;s sake!&amp;quot;. More important
than that is a look at Mandela&#x27;s character, it was fresh insight, and
Morgan Freeman does do a good job. How accurate all this is another
issue though, but this is one of the best movies based in South Africa.
It&#x27;s production design reminds me of a &lt;em&gt;Cry Freedom&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; (about another key
South African politician), as if it&#x27;s some sort of tradition.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Malcolm X&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, which I considered a masterpiece for years (after a mere
one viewing), was far less impressive on a revisit. It&#x27;s not boring,
but there&#x27;s hardly much going for it, and none of the performances are
any good (they are below average, all but Denzel Washington; Angela
Basset is desirable but also cardboard), the camerawork and production
design not ok, the story standard, and the whole thing overlong. It&#x27;s
remains an interesting exploration of the kind of shit people tend to be
so ready to believe (and die for).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/sintel-disappoints/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sintel.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Sintel&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is the latest movie project by the Blender Foundation, and
they&#x27;ve been cooking it for over a year now, and the result is really
disappointing, and as with their &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;project-peach-disappoints&quot;&gt;previous movie&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, I still feel that
their first movie, &lt;em&gt;Elephants Dream&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, is superior both technically and
artistically.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;human character animation is really bad, maybe worse than the first
&lt;em&gt;Toy Story&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;; okay they could not afford motion-capture suits, so I
guess they can be forgiven?&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the whole thing looks unfinished (EG, much of the environment looks
too clean, too smooth)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;character design sux; just look at the old man, and the dragons&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the lead character is not interesting, nor is she a convincing
warrior; maybe a juicier ass would have helped, since I suspect the
movie-makers chose a female character for sex appeal; how else am I
supposed to swallow a story where a 16-year old gal holds her own
while battling a few unfriendly characters (including a fully-grown
dragon!)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the whole thing feels empty; when the credits roll you murmur
something along the lines of &amp;quot;is that it!&amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a more positive note, the final battle is rather intense, and I wish
it should have lasted longer. Otherwise there isn&#x27;t much in this that
motivates me to go watch this 15-minute piece again. That this was done
with FLOSS is not grounds for a dishonest review.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Date Night&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, Mark Wahlberg plays the koolest guy in movies so far
this year; he&#x27;s hot, he got the sexiest gal imaginable who &#x27;speaks
little English&#x27;, he&#x27;s got the koolest IT toys, and a number of
not-cheap sports cars. Okay, he&#x27;s not quite as rich as Tony Stark
(&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;iron-man-2&quot;&gt;Iron Man 2&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;), but he wins regardless.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&#x27;t watched &lt;em&gt;Reservoir Dogs&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; in many years and a revisit wasn&#x27;t
a let-down at all. Superb direction, excellent acting, exciting
characters (all of them, especially big boss, his son, and Harvey
Keitel). The opening scene is top-class and so is the dialogue
throughout. The movie is amazingly meaningless too.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazing how &lt;em&gt;Dog Day Afternoon&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; will test your patience; the one guy
whose portrayal I enjoyed more than Al Pacino&#x27;s is the hostage
negotiator. I like his great concern for the kidnapped. Very impressive
performance. Oh, did anyone note the great resemblance between the lead
FBI guy and George Bush, jnr.?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One bright spark in the (extremely) awful &lt;em&gt;The Expendables&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is the
desirable gal&#x27;s artwork (and her too of course).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only is it&#x27;s blatant religiosity disgusting, not to mention an
unsatisfactory lead performance, but &lt;em&gt;The Book of Eli&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is also like a
cheap imitation of an &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;i-am-legend&quot;&gt;I Am Legend&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one thing I heard about the legend of &lt;em&gt;Robin Hood&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is that he stole
from the rich in the interests of the poor, and the movie turns out to
be a Braveheart imitation instead, complete with romance and
kingdom-wide heroism, and hardly any theft by this hero. Although it&#x27;s
pretty good, it&#x27;s standard fare, and dull too, and nothing in it
justifies its existence at all. There&#x27;s nothing new and movie makers
know it. WTF! Other than for financial gain, why the fuck did they make
it?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;There&#x27;s a bunch of people for whom acting seems as effortless as
breathing. It seems for them an excellent performance isn&#x27;t much of a
challenge. I&#x27;m talking of people like Al Pacino, Gene Hackman, and in
the case of &lt;em&gt;Wolfman&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, Anthony Hopkins. The movie itself is not so good
(story not fresh; campy visual effects) and I wonder why someone of
Anthony&#x27;s prestige would take part in it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Armored&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is well-made, well-shot, and got Laurence Fishburne, and also
got a concept not before explored in my experience, but someone failed
to come up with a decent enough plot, or a justification for the
after-the-fact cruelty. It&#x27;s a beautiful set-up that just got wasted.
Maybe the initial writer died, and someone was under pressure to get it
over with :-)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <title>Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (2009)</title>
                <pubDate>Mon, 04 Oct 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

                <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;first-review-2009&quot;&gt;first review (2009)&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course the 2nd &lt;em&gt;Transformers&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; movie is going to have superior visual
effects to its &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;transformers-2007&quot;&gt;predecessor&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; but nothing more groundbreaking. You oughta
love the destruction of the aircraft carrier though. And the same
complaint I had with the first one is that there&#x27;s way too much going
on as regards the action such that I can&#x27;t keep up.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It appears I wasn&#x27;t the only one who loved the human hero&#x27;s parents in
the first movie, as evidenced by their far greater screen presence here,
and they don&#x27;t misstep here too. But they don&#x27;t help advance the
story, which is pretty much non-existent anyways.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#x27;t remember anything believable, and at the end of it ya feel like
&lt;em&gt;what a waste!&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, but then the entire concept of the Transformers is
pre-juvenile anyways!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;second-review-2010&quot;&gt;second review (2010)&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A revisit of &lt;em&gt;The Transformers 2&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; was an unpleasant experience. It makes
apparent the farce&#x2F;silliness the entire concept actually is. I am
especially annoyed by the impossible survival our heroes have, and worse
still, none of the members of the military are any interesting. It&#x27;s
nearly unbearable and just too noisy. It&#x27;s as bad as the first.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Death At the Funeral&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; got excellent set-design (check the furniture)
and good camerawork, spoilt by a story that exposes its rot
halfway-through and worsens near the end. On a political note, it&#x27;s sad
that the movie perpetuates the idea that homosexuality as disgusting and
embarassing :-(&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was pleasantly surprised of the excellence that is &lt;em&gt;The A-Team&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. It&#x27;s
filled with superb and never-before-seen action, interesting characters
(my favorite is the smart, tough, and villainous gunman), and good
storyline. [&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;many-many-recent-movies&quot;&gt;update&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Knight &amp;amp; Day&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, a half-serious secret agent story with a romantic touch,
is similar to &lt;em&gt;Mr. &amp;amp; Mrs Smith&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; (but not nearly as good). It&#x27;s got nice
action and an uninteresting Tom Cruise, but Cameron Diaz is a
what-a-doll!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/knowing/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;The visual effects of &lt;em&gt;Knowing&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; are top-class, and the story is
interesting initially, but the pacing tends to be overly-slow,
especially with the boring daughter of the &#x27;possessed&#x27; woman (a bad
and unbearable performance). We also got some boring aliens, and the
whole thing turns out to be seriously idiotic (think &lt;em&gt;Close Encounters
of the Third Kind&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, itself a better movie). It&#x27;s unbelievable. Nicolas
Cage also shows the limits of his talent, especially near the end. The
kids are boring too. The alien space-ship, an obvious inspiration from
&lt;em&gt;Dark City&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; visual look (a movie made by the same director) leaves
nothing to admire, evne though it&#x27;s entrance is given the grand and
wondrous treament of traditional Hollywood, complete with a loud score
and childlike &amp;quot;wow&amp;quot; of the onlooker. It&#x27;s a bad movie, but is
gorgeously-shot, and each of the action-pieces, all 4 disaster points
(plane crash, train-smach, truck hit, and armageddon) are all worthy of
repeat viewing, and hence, admiration.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#x27;t remember a movie that happens to be so okay but crumbles so
hard on revelation of its plot, which in this case happens at the end.
What a mess! Or, there&#x27;s even paradise, and nobody explains why the
hell the seemingly advanced aliens aren&#x27;t saving more people. It&#x27;s so
stupid. Strangely this is a revisit, but I forgot these horrid factors.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/festen-1998/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;The painful story of &lt;em&gt;Festen&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; was powerful enough to have me label it a
masterpiece. Unfortunately that honor didn&#x27;t survive a revisit. I still
consider it very well-made (only a master-director can make such a
movie, given its &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Dogme_95&quot;&gt;self-imposed limits&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;), and the emotions it stirs are
still high-impact, and the story is important enough that I&#x27;d promote
it heavily if I had the means.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;strong&gt;sidenote&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;] The very first scene is intensely horrid, one where
super-asshole chases wife and kids outta the car. It was hard to
swallow.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

Pounds&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; are among those movies that have a not-so-common property of
being about as good on a revisit as the first viewing.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#x27;s hardly any other gal that has been given such a beloved
portrayal as Will Smith&#x27;s sweetheart in &lt;em&gt;Seven Pounds&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I Think I Love My Wife&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is well-made and got some of the hottest
collection of gals of all movies. It&#x27;s a nice display of the challenge
of resisting temptation.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/recent-revisits-2010-08-15/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;The gal in &lt;em&gt;Hitman&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is damn desirable, the movie so average (but I like
the early scene set in Africa). Here&#x27;s an old review from early 2008,
and is still relevant:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hitman&#x27;s title character is too flawless to be believable but the
characterisation and the decent performance makes the movie
entertaining, barren as it is. The cop searching for our assassin
gives the movie&#x27;s best performance.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ocean&#x27;s 12&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is still a great such a pleasure, as good as the first
viewing, and among the highlights is Bruce Willis playing himself.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bespectacled villain in &lt;em&gt;Miami Vice&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; gives the movie&#x27;s best
performance, and Gong Li, as ever, is a pain to watch because she
carries a face that is too sad to bear, even when she smiles. The movie
isn&#x27;t as gritty as the first time I watched it, but I still like the
rescue scene, where the heroic officer expresses superiority.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;This movie is intense and has so many gems spread all over it that I&#x27;m
tempted to call it masterpiece. The experience was better than the first
time around.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of what caused this celebration:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taraji P. Hanson&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taraji P. Hanson&#x27;s rifle&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Common carrying Alicia Keys&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FBI poser&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;concept (multiple pro-killers targeting one guy)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mafia telephone conversation&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the murderous neo-nazi trio&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;fight-club-1999&quot;&gt;Fight Club&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; before it, the movie is packed too much of goodness.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier review:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It got &lt;em&gt;Se7en&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&#x27;s theme of super-smart villain who got everything
figured; difference here is that the villain&#x27;s deeds aren&#x27;t so
well-justified, and its creators ignored what made &lt;em&gt;Se7en&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&#x27;s ending
great, which spoils what is an otherwise superbly-made and -acted
movie.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A revisit left a bitter taste in mouth, and none of the major performers
helped. In fact, I was surprised by how bad Gerard Butler was. I must
have been blinded by my love for him in &lt;em&gt;300&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/recent-movies-2010-07-26/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;There&#x27;s a gem here and there in &lt;em&gt;Chicago&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, but my favorite is the
moment where the lawyer&#x27;s manipulation are portrayed by showing him as
puppet master (the puppets being the murderer and the press), and the
song accompanying that scene.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#x27;s gems here and there in the rather overrated &lt;em&gt;Annie Hall&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; (EG,
when the protagonist speaks to strangers, and part of his character when
he gets honest and straight-to-the-point). The movie however tends to
drag and seems pointless, more of a mental exercise and an exploration
of one clumsy, confused guy. By the way, this is the only movie so far
that I&#x27;ve ever enjoyed Diane Keaton&#x27;s performance.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Constantine&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is still enjoyable due to the exotic story of its Satan
(who&#x27;s portrayed so well) vs. God thing - the deals they made, the
pawns they created (angel Ghabriel is done so well, and so is the
charming demon; not to forget the half-headed not-so-charming ones in
hell), the worlds they created. The whole thing is also a reminder of
the great size of bull-crap that Abrahamic religions are.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s rare that one would enjoy a movie as well as first time. That&#x27;s
the case with &lt;em&gt;Ghost Dog&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, a movie devoid of any flashy imagery or
decent cinematography. The lead, the title character, is portrayed so
well by Forest Whitaker, and the movie is littered with what looks like
meaningless signatures (tragedy at the end, the idiocy of the villains,
the dog, RZA); the relationships Ghost Dog has with the French guy and
the young girl are beautiful, coloring what is otherwise a dark, dull,
and ugly world; the movie itself feels purposeless (if we don&#x27;t count
its entertainment value). [&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;ghost-dog&quot;&gt;older review&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <pubDate>Tue, 13 Jul 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
                <link>http://tshepang.net/citizen-kane-1941/</link>
                <guid>http://tshepang.net/citizen-kane-1941/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;So I checked out &lt;em&gt;Citizen Kane&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; again (last time was maybe 8 years ago),
and came back even more surprised why the fuck so many of the world&#x27;s
top movie critics proclaim it &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Films_considered_the_greatest_ever&quot;&gt;the greatest movie ever made&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. I must say
though that the director, Orson Welles, ain&#x27;t that bad of an actor (but
someone should have worked harder at his old-age make-up). Oh, and I
love the in-movie campaign poster, the one that shows the image of the
character he played.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe I must find out what &#x27;greatest&#x27; means. Maybe it means influence,
in which case then I wouldn&#x27;t complain (I suppose the non-linear
storytelling and cinematography were groundbreaking), but if it means
&#x27;best&#x27;, well...&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amores Perros&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is very rich, but also very disturbing and full of pain:
car accident, dog-fighting, trapped dog.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;American Psycho&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is a bit similar to &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;fight-club-1999&quot;&gt;Fight Club&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;: it&#x27;s about a
financially sound guy who finds no meaning to life, and eventually goes
insane. The one difference is it&#x27;s far less accomplished and feels as
purposeless as it&#x27;s protagonist, but is entertaining enough to be worth
a revisit.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although revisiting &lt;em&gt;Confessions of a Dangerous Mind&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; wasn&#x27;t bad at all
(Drew Barrymore is desirable, George Clooney is interesting), it left me
feeling that I don&#x27;t need to see it ever again: the half-serious story
is just too erratic.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Claiming a movie you didn&#x27;t enjoy watching to be good is tough at
times. in my case, that&#x27;s &lt;em&gt;Zodiac&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. I wonder what the motivation of
making it was, but it at least boasts a superb performance by &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;John_Carroll_Lynch&quot;&gt;John
Carroll Lynch&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, the highly-suspicious suspect. This &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;zodiac-and-david-fincher&quot;&gt;performance I
honored last time&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; wasn&#x27;t fit for a revisit.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;So this sweet lady (Maggie Gyllenhaal) falls for this alcoholic guy (and
I wonder why since the guy looks like he smells like shit; maybe it&#x27;s
because she a sucker for the guy&#x27;s music). She allows the guy to chill
with her kid with the condition that he not drink in front of him. Well,
it does happen, and the guy loses the kid while both are in a bar,
though the kid is found hours later. As would be expected, &#x27;sweet
lady&#x27; goes mad and despite repeated pleading, does not forgive the guy.
I think that&#x27;s harsh, even for him. One good outcome however was that
that was a wake-up call for him to actually quit drinking, and he even
accepted the break-up (I didn&#x27;t).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie is good, but boring. The acting is even better, especially
from the lead, Jeff Bridges (who looks so much like Kris Kristofferson,
I thought it was him). Maggie is as desirable as usual.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Of the highest-rated of Akira Kirosawa&#x27;s movies, &lt;em&gt;Rashomon&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is given
the stature of &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;seven-samurai-1954&quot;&gt;Seven Samurai&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, if not more, but for me it&#x27;s just a
dumb story with bad acting. In fact I found its ridiculousness
unbearable in this revisit. Regardless, Toshiro Mifune is really an
interesting actor, but happened to be given a shitty role, where he
practically is a madman. I also enjoyed the performance of the inquisive
guy, though he overdoes it, not to mention silly grins and forced
laughter.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;There is not a single performance (and I mean that) in &lt;em&gt;An Education&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
that isn&#x27;t top-class, but favorites are the girl&#x27;s silent mom and the
glamorous blonde (such beauty!). The director also excels, but all this
hides the fact that the characters don&#x27;t have real depth, especially
the girl&#x27;s mom (door mat!), while the dad is not much more than a
caricature.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fate of the man who got strapped with bombs got me bursting out in
tears in the not-so-typical war movie, &lt;em&gt;The Hurt Locker&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. We also get a
whole lot of detail deliberately left out. I&#x27;m left without knowing
whether to herald such soldiers as heroic or not.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Climaxed by the very last scene which is damn too hard to swallow, &lt;em&gt;The
Magdalene Sisters&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is a horrid portrayal of young women forced into
slavery, in laundry facilities. I was praying while watching that the
entire thing is fictional, but it appears it&#x27;s a true story, as
evidenced by the who-ended-up-where that is typical of such.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hunted&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&#x27;s cinematography and production design make it look like some
made-for-tv fare; The first scene really sucks and the hand-to-hand
battling isn&#x27;t as impressive as on &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-hunted-2003&quot;&gt;1st look&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#x27;s a painful mini-twist in &lt;em&gt;Up In the Air&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;; Vera Farmiga, playing
a fuck buddy, is desirable while at the same time exuding maturity and
wisdom; the opening credits sequence is pretty good, and so is the
sound.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <title>Kinsey (2004)</title>
                <pubDate>Wed, 24 Feb 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
                <link>http://tshepang.net/kinsey-2004/</link>
                <guid>http://tshepang.net/kinsey-2004/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;The title character of Kinsey, who is granted a committed performance by
Liam Neeson, is a relentless and brave scientist who embarks on studies
of human sexuality. The movie&#x27;s academic and smart dialogue reminds me
pretty much of &lt;em&gt;Wit&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, and among its notable moments was a touching scene
where Kinsey feels pain for his father&#x27;s past, a moment that brought
tear to eye, though nothing compared to the volume of tear delivered by
a later interview with an elderly lady who happened to be grateful of
the professor&#x27;s book. The movie itself is a serious work, and one
that&#x27;s totally devoid of cinematic gloss.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prof Kinsey must be my favorite human character in my movie memory
(stern, professional, unflinchingly unapologetic about the scientific
value of his work, intelligent, brave, adventurous, and brutally
honest). I won&#x27;t risk my integrity by saying he&#x27;s the best-developed
character in that admittedly weak memory, but when thinking of such a
guy who went against the status quo by doing controversial research in
American&#x27;s sexual deeds, a tear nearly fills the eye.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leeson&#x27;s performance, excellent as it is, isn&#x27;t award-worthy, but I&#x27;m
too shallow to imagine anyone who can better him in this role.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/hancock-2008/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;I believe something got seriously fucked-up during the production of
&lt;em&gt;Hancock&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; because the pre-twist moments are amazingly fresh and original
and about everything afterwards is shitty:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;unnecessary brawl that should have taken place elsewhere other than
the city&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;underdeveloped explanation of super-ability&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;annoying plot-holes&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It feels like someone came up with a good story and didn&#x27;t know where
to run with it, and in those moments of panic, hashed up something that
will disappoint any viewer.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily all casting is spot-on. Check...&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the 1st corporate meeting&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the PR guy and his wife&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the inmates&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the kids&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also some of the action (and visual effects) is pretty good (check the
train smash). This a really fresh kinda superhero and it makes one
salivate for (superior) sequels.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was interesting to find that &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hancock_(film)#Reception&quot;&gt;so many critics agreed&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; that the move
started well and screwed up about halfway through.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;There haven&#x27;t been many characters as unpleasant and bitter as Marlon
Brando&#x27;s asshole in &lt;em&gt;Last Tango in Paris&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;; I could not bear watching
this movie at one go because it really is depressing and sleep-inducing,
and happens to be way too eccentric (the subplot about the relationship
the documentrary director and the beloved gal).I checked out the buzz
and discovered that Pauline Kael, praised by many as the greatest ever
movie critic, &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nybooks.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;archives&#x2F;1995&#x2F;mar&#x2F;23&#x2F;finding-it-at-the-movies&#x2F;&quot;&gt;did fall for it&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. I just gotta go find time to read that
piece.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I had intense anticipation for &lt;em&gt;Ninja Assassin&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, and its intro lived up
to the expectation while the rest failed (the momentum is lost even
before halfway through). The brutality against the kids is hard to
swallow. The supernatural powers are left unexplained &amp;amp; martial arts
choreography could be better. What I liked though is the movie helped
wake up the appealing mystery of Ninja lore, which will hopefully pave
the way for superior works.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&#x27;t dig deep enough in my memory to find a movie as lame as &lt;em&gt;Skin&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;,
a real-life drama set in apartheid South Africa; the editing disgusts,
leaving one suspecting that it was a rushed job.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;It is formulaic and stale, but I loved the funny scene where a group of
shopaholics come together to help cure their obsession; I also loved the
flawless dummy visual effects.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/fracture-2007/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;A notable element from this movie is the performance of the lead by Ryan
Gosling, who is sort of like a hit from nowhere since I haven&#x27;t seen
him before. Yet another notable element is the sophisticated and
humorous dialogue, though the script itself falls short near the end,
incapable of justifying various activities done by the villain.
Fortunately there wasn&#x27;t any formulaic non-sense common in movies.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story proved a bit sketchy and not so brilliant on second look,
while Rosamund Pike remains a goddess, while Anthony Hopkins pulls off a
great and effortless performance.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Jia Xhag-ke&#x27;s Xiao Wu is nearly as dull as his Platform, but rescued by
it&#x27;s shorter running time and sprinkled with some joy in a form of the
romance that transpires, a romance that helps one sympathize with the
otherwise annoyingly-boring and cold title character. A more observant
critic saw far &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;sensesofcinema.com&#x2F;2003&#x2F;great-directors&#x2F;jia&#x2F;&quot;&gt;more than I did&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The World is quite a gem: the romance is heartfelt (Jia is real good on
that subject, as he proved in Xiao Wu), and the friendship between the
Chinese and Russian sweet. Jia is also capable of having me cringe at
the ridiculousness&#x2F;mediocrity of humanity since the title of the movie
actually refers to the theme park of various world landmarks, EG a
smaller replica of The Eiffel Tower, and, worse even, people taking
themselves photos in front of the fakes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I don&#x27;t remember a movie whose visual effects are of this scale, and
only those of &lt;em&gt;King Kong&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;top-visual-effects&quot;&gt;are superior&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. The early scenes are much fun,
with nice superficial touches reminiscent of &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;transformers-2007&quot;&gt;Transformers&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. The whole
thing is dragged by some family drama as well as an uninteresting John
Cusack. Me loves the designs of the arks. The &#x27;chase&#x27; scenes, all an
excuse to showcase the extravaganza that is the effects, are pure fun. I
also enjoyed the large Russian billionaire, an otherwise unconvincing
buffoon that offers much comic relief.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;On a much lighter note, I found &lt;em&gt;Sponge Bob&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; surprisingly good, given
its bad taste crude animation style. Its humour and wit is top-class,
but it&#x27;s forgettable at the same time, especially since I find myself
not remembering much, a day after watching it. It&#x27;s unfortunately
spoilt by mixing it with some live-action.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ice Age 3&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; failed to live to the stellar expectations suggested by its
immediate predecessor, although I liked the otherwise overdone one-eyed
guide.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chen Kaige&#x27;s &lt;em&gt;The Promise&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is nearly as annoyingly bad as his other
overly-depressing piece of shit, &lt;em&gt;The Emperor &amp;amp; the Assassin&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. Strange
for a guy who excelled with &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;yellow-earth-1984&quot;&gt;Yellow Earth&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I remember with great fondness what an impact &lt;em&gt;Breakfast Club&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; had on me
over 10 years ago. The characters are interesting, the dialogue decent,
and storyline still got a punch. It&#x27;s about school kids in detention,
each interestingly an all too common movie formula +++ sportsman, prom
queen, punk, brainy, weirdo +++ and the movie is a good attempt at
exposing the problems each goes through as they get more than enough of
a chance to confide into each other. Oh, and Claire, prom queen
character, is a babe really.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Jia Zhangke&#x27;s &lt;em&gt;Still Life&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is surprisingly-good, partly because it&#x27;s
far better than his tremendously-overrated &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;recent-ex-anticipated-movies&quot;&gt;Platform&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. It has beautiful
camerawork and the story is handled with great skill, allowing one to
get lost in it, as if experiencing the pain of both poverty and lost
parental love with the characters. It&#x27;s also blessed with a beloved
leading lady.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a much lighter note is &lt;em&gt;Monsters vs. Aliens&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; which starts off like
sub-standard fare until the US president shows up, the prison warder,
and a whole bunch of other characters, adding serious comic punch. It&#x27;s
however way too quirky, like no one involved wanted any awards.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Although nobody cares to explain why the obsessed is obsessed in
Obsessed, we get quite a treat with a seriously-gorgeous,
not-too-incompetent Beyonce and a perfect gentleman of a husband as well
a decent cast and direction. Someone worked real hard to get that guy as
perfect as it gets by the way, and in way I don&#x27;t remember in movie
history.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I figured the popularity of Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s Psycho was way overblown
after watching it for the first time, but there&#x27;s one superb scene
where the private detective (a real good performance) questions the
suspect, whose tense emotions are well-enhanced by the camera angle
(which would be a bit of a spoiler for one who hasn&#x27;t seen it). Rest of
the stuff is just banal and the end-scene (the explanation), though
well-acted, doesn&#x27;t help.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can imagine what I thought All That Jazz was about especially since
I had no idea what the story was, and yeah it&#x27;s not about jazz at all.
It&#x27;s luckily sprinkled here and there with good dance sequences, but
since it was done in the US 80&#x27;s (okay, that&#x27;s 1979, but it&#x27;s close
enough), there&#x27;s bad costumes, hair styles, and music all over the
place, and is nearly unbearable with its eccentricity and the depressing
ailment moments. The music-infused delusions the protagonist goes
through don&#x27;t help either, regardless of how innovative the whole
treatise may be. Highlights: the sex dance sequence, and the daughter &amp;amp;
lover sequence, and even some decent comic touches, EG some of the
hospital scenes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;David Fincher decided to go all &lt;em&gt;Forrest Gump&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; on us with &lt;em&gt;The Curious
Case of Benjamin Button&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. Here&#x27;s a &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.austinchronicle.com&#x2F;gyrobase&#x2F;Calendar&#x2F;Film?Film=oid:716015&quot;&gt;good review&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a more positive note, Tilda Swinton is tremendously elegant and
provides a real accomplished appearance. Cate Blanchett is a pleasure to
watch as always as the main love interest, but nothing is as striking as
the visual effects done on Brad Pitt&#x27;s twenty-something face.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sidenote&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: Interestingly I later found that both movies were written
by the same person.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Midnight Cowboy&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, Dustin Hoffman plays a character so broken that he
depresses all the time, and better off dead. John Voigt plays the only
friend he could ever have, and is even dumber. Luckily we find a ray of
light in the husky-voiced gal who does rock proper... and I wonder what
the main point of the movie is.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One could easily get fooled into thinking Sergio Leone&#x27;s &lt;em&gt;Once Upon A
Time in America&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is good, judging by the beautiful opening sequence, but
it ends up a pompous and disorganised mess. There&#x27;s a few good
performances here and there and Robert De Niro, whose cruel and
underdeveloped character, doesn&#x27;t provide anything above the usual.
&lt;em&gt;Once Upon A Time in the West&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, by the same director, is far better and
full of rather interesting characters (but is no match of his &lt;em&gt;The Good,
The Bad, and the Ugly&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Akira Kirosawa&#x27;s &lt;em&gt;Ran&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is the worst of his works I&#x27;ve seen so far (and
even worse than &lt;em&gt;Once Upon A Time in America&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;), and is not helped by its
preposterous acting especially by that of the conqueror whose retirement
is less than comfortable. Of some note is his close aide, the mocking
entertainer whose utterances are often of good wisdom. One that caught
my attention is &amp;quot;Enduring ridicule, I seek to entertain&amp;quot;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antonio Banderas has a good turn as a simple, yet ambitious, thug in the
eccentric &lt;em&gt;Tie Me Up, Tie Me Down&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, where he got his way of achieving
his dream. Victoria Abril is a pleasure to watch (as usual) playing an
equally broken character, though maybe a bit worse since she also
doesn&#x27;t know what she wants.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Farewell My Concubine was the most memorable of those Chen Kaige&#x2F;Zhang
Yimou movies that I had for so long wanted to watch (until this year)
and therefore was supposed to be luminous, but turns out to be an
overlong, boring and pointless piece of shit. It does however partly
exposes the unsettling horrors of China&#x27;s Cultural Revolution. I
strongly suspect that the exposure it got was to due to the then-brave
touch of homosexuality.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even worse and less interesting is what the great &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;best-movie-critic-jonathan-rosenbaum&quot;&gt;Jonathan Rosenbaum&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
felt to be the best mainland Chinese movie ever, Platform. It turned out
to lack any interesting characters and story. It&#x27;s a fucking mystery
that anyone liked (or made) it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;The backdrop of &lt;em&gt;The Story of Qiu Ju&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is Chinese rural poor and the
story is of a strong-willed and simple-minded woman fighting with the
law to get a man who harmed her husband to apologize, nothing more and
nothing less (and it would be a spoiler to say which of the 2 she gets).
Gong Li, who plays the title character in this The Story of Qiu Ju is at
her best, and the direction is simple and raw. Oh, and the poverty and
suffering displayed is unsettling.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This story is more powerful than even &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;yellow-earth-1984&quot;&gt;Yellow Earth&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and with many more
strong actors, while the winter weather looks even more harsh.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <pubDate>Mon, 04 May 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
                <link>http://tshepang.net/once-upon-a-time-in-china-series/</link>
                <guid>http://tshepang.net/once-upon-a-time-in-china-series/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Once Upon A Time in China 2&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; has some of the greatest martial arts
stunts ever committed to screen and is overall far superior to its
unbearably-bad predecessor. I also wish the whole series was based on
something other than the Chinese&#x27;s conflict with Western influence,
especially because Caucasians in are extrememly underdevloped and given
shitty performances worse than Keanu Reeve&#x27;s worst.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interesting that things actually get better with the 3rd in the &lt;em&gt;Once
Upon A Time In China&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; series which is much better fun and therefore
feels much shorter than the previous two. The romance between the
protagonist and his relative (such awesome beauty) is touching and
sweet; the comic touches are a real delight but the dragon fights are
boring and too complex; martial arts choreography is lesser than the 2nd
movie even though none of the characters of the previous movies quite
matches the attractiveness of Clubfoot, whose kick can paralyse even
masters.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&#x27;t tell if the 4th in the series sucks worse than the 1st but it
lost Jet Li and the humor and is damn cheap while offering jack that&#x27;s
new. But the 5th at least is a revival of the series&#x27; former glory, and
the movie must have provided some inspiration for &lt;em&gt;Pirates of the
Caribbean&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, most especially the age-old pirate who nearly is a Davey
Jones. I didn&#x27;t even miss Jet Li, and the large-eyed student has his
best moment when his dream of being praised comes true.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My previous dislike for the 6th and last in the series, which must be at
least a decade ago, leaves me surprised since I enjoyed it so much this
time around, and another plus is that the Caucasians aren&#x27;t sticks no
more, and even with decent acting in places (the town&#x27;s mayor and its
sheriff). Oh, and it takes place in the Wild West, albeit with an
uninteresting wolf-killer villain. There&#x27;s one praiseworthy moment -
the touching and heroic efforts of Clubfoot when attempting to bring
back his master&#x27;s memory, touching when mentioning the commendable acts
of the master, heroic when battling the far superior master as
self-sacrifice.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;The best performer in &lt;em&gt;Raise the Red Lantern&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is the lady who gave up
her career as an opera singer to get married to an uncaring rich man to
whom women are disposable mere objects. Even more painful is the
life-long servitude that many take, where they accept to be treated like
lesser humans. I do wonder what message the movie attempts to portray
though, and I also feel lucky I wasn&#x27;t born in old China!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wanted&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is nice, flashy, and as unaccomplished as I expected, but has
the most beautiful suicide scene in memory.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;This Bond we find in &lt;em&gt;Quantum of Solace&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; must be the most intense yet,
and partakes in equally-intense thrills, and in what is perhaps the best
Bond movie yet. Actually the movie&#x27;s first half (and its action) is so
good that it reminds of (the superior) &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;taken-2008&quot;&gt;Taken&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, even though it got
spoilt by the revenging beauty (incompetent performance, stale character
and subplot) and an even worse finale.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Me don&#x27;t quite know what to make of the well-made &lt;em&gt;Seven Pounds&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;,
giving one no clue what the whole thing is about &#x27;till the end, while
having Woody Harrelson (perhaps) and Rosario Dawson giving their career
best appearances. And that suspense simply wasn&#x27;t acceptable too, and I
also wonder what the story advocates... be good? And it&#x27;s a very good
movie too.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was not going to post a comment, but the gal in &lt;em&gt;Body of Lies&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is
tremendously gorgeous and desirable, a central attraction in a real good
movie spoilt by an untalented lead.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sean Penn is admirable for managing to transform self so well, away from
typical macho types he often plays, to a homosexual radical in &lt;em&gt;Milk&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.
Among the finest actors surely, though he&#x27;s done better before.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had fun with Clint Eastwood&#x27;s mild humour in an otherwise average
&lt;em&gt;Gran Torino&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, while the much worse &lt;em&gt;Role Models&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; had a
surprisely-enjoyable &#x27;final battle&#x27;. Even funnier is &lt;em&gt;Yes Man&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, which
got a fresh concept but is fucked by common romantic comedy pitfalls.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Me wonders why The Watchowski Brothers decided to ignore the path of
decency (Bound, The Matrix) by doing an over-stylized (with bad taste
visual design) and childish Speed Racer. Almost neglected to mention an
annoying cast and bad directing.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Guy Ritchie&#x27;s &lt;em&gt;Rock &#x27;n Rolla&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is quite a delight, it&#x27;s not
quite up there with his &lt;em&gt;Snatch&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;; Although there&#x27;s no match for Brad
Pitt, we got a nice title character player and actually a lot more other
players than its superior (Russian mafia head, his 2 tough guys, movie
lover, Gerard Butler, English lord&#x27;s right-hand-man, ...)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I don&#x27;t remember any movie based in India quite as rich and vivid as
&lt;em&gt;Slumdog Millionaire&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, a painful and seemingly pointless exercise which
happens to be India&#x27;s answer to the far superior &lt;em&gt;City of God&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.
[&lt;strong&gt;update&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: a revisit didn&#x27;t prove very favourable, tempting me to
replace &#x27;far&#x27; with &#x27;once&#x27;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a pleasant surprise to find Darren Aronofsky helming &lt;em&gt;The
Wrestler&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, a small but solid, yet-another-fallen-sportsman-story with an
amazing cast and a very strong Mickey Rourke, whose character is in such
pain that death ought to be better. And this movie appears the most
conventional of Aronofsky&#x27;s (think of the mesmerising &lt;em&gt;Pi&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; or the
heart-wrenching &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;requiem-for-a-dream-2000&quot;&gt;Requiem for A Dream&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a lighter note, we got the most enchanting &lt;em&gt;Wall-E&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, a touching story
of undefeatable love which got a strange quality of very quick
story-telling, and not a dull moment. It&#x27;s superior even to its awesome
predecessor, &lt;em&gt;Robots&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. It&#x27;s on the league of &lt;em&gt;Monsters, Inc.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The
Incredibles&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Ratatouille&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; on their heydey.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was delighted by the light-hearted &lt;em&gt;Zack &amp;amp; Miri Make A Porno&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; until it
insulted me with shitty-ass, formulaic, romantic comedy bullshit towards
the end.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Numerous Adam Sandler comedies have showcased him as a laid-back and
tough guy, but none with the flair of &lt;em&gt;You Don&#x27;t Mess With the Zohan&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;,
a weird and exciting fantasy&#x2F;satire regarding middle-Eastern peoples.
The only comparably-excellent movie Adam has been in is &lt;em&gt;Punch-Drunk
Love&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;The movie offers at least one superb one-liner:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not artificial intelligence; actual intelligence!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also offers wonderful character design. I just wish it could have
been more scathing (and less childish), it being a war satire and all.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/ghost-dog/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;It has the common basic story of a contract killer forced to target own
clients, but considering that you got Jim Jarmusch at the helm, you bet
&lt;em&gt;Ghost Dog&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; won&#x27;t be your typical ride. It&#x27;s unlike anything I&#x27;ve
seen before and is totally devoid of Hollywood gloss and seemingly on a
shoe-string budget. It&#x27;s armed with quite an exotic story (modern-day
Black Samurai who consumes copious amounts of literature and uses
pigeons to communicate with his employers) and got nice comic touches.
The sub-plot involving the kid and the ice-cream man is nice too, and
helps lighten the mood, while serving the main story in other useful
ways. [&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;revisiting-ghost-dog&quot;&gt;newer review&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

is Ger Ryan who plays mother of the two girls who are going through
personal crises in &lt;em&gt;interMission&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, a sweet and touching portrayal, and
very natural.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <title>The Dark Knight (2008)</title>
                <pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
                <link>http://tshepang.net/the-dark-knight-2008/</link>
                <guid>http://tshepang.net/the-dark-knight-2008/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;I can&#x27;t really express the excitement the movie induced into me, mainly
due to Heath Ledger&#x27;s The Joker, a great contender for the best ever
villainous character in movie history. This character is the centerpiece
of the whole movie, and actually makes everybody else pretty
uninteresting, including the Dark Knight himself. What makes the
character so interesting is beyond just the acting, but also its unusual
philosophical leanings, personality (no fear for death whatsoever),
genius-level smarts (extremely elaborate and effective plans), all of
which makes the material feel real fresh and making this character
thoroughly developed. The character is also fearsome, funny, and
seriously cunning.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&#x27;t say there&#x27;s anything outstanding about the visual effects (the
&lt;em&gt;Batman&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; series never impressed in this front) and the chase sequences
don&#x27;t rock so hard (EG the Knight&#x27;s super-sized motorbike could have
done with greater speed to enhance the feeling of adrenaline, but
instead felt like it was slouching around at 60km&#x2F;h). The single
greatest visual effect however is Two-Face&#x27;s ugly side. Though nothing
groundbreaking, it&#x27;s somewhat a first, combining a live face with some
very realistic effects. An early bank robbery scene is pure fun and much
of the action is so sophisticated and complex that it&#x27;s hard to keep
track of what happens. It&#x27;s the movie&#x27;s best.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s great length (over 150 minutes) allows room for some shit to creep
in (Two-Face shouldn&#x27;t have been afforded a sub-plot) but it&#x27;s so
amazing elsewhere that it&#x27;s easily the best ever comic book adaptation
(replacing &lt;em&gt;Batman Begins&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Iron Man&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, I&#x27;m pretty glad that the Knight&#x27;s romantic interest has
been recast cuz&#x27; the previous actress was the weakest point in the
magnificent &lt;em&gt;Batman Begins&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second look at &lt;em&gt;The Dark Knight&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; wasn&#x27;t favorable, all but:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Heath Ledger&#x27;s The Joker, the year&#x27;s performance&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the bank robbery in an early scene&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not even the action saves the movie, which was mostly wasted cash since
it ain&#x27;t really good. And the last scene really is unbearable. And who
gives a shit about the cheap philosophical blah I so previously
cherished.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, no, this isn&#x27;t the best ever comic book adaptation.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;1st review:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Incredible Hulk&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; has got a great fight between Hulk and &#x27;an
abomination&#x27; and is far better than its shitty predecessor. The
scenic (and abused) views of the massive Latin American slums are
memorable.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2nd review:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found William Hurt unbearable, while Liv Tyler and Tim Roth didn&#x27;t
help much. Not even the battle of monsters, which itself did lose its
appeal, saves the movie.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ve since watched Disney&#x27;s &lt;em&gt;Pocahontas&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; over a decade ago and
remember it leaving quite an impression, and it does deserve a revisit,
even though I&#x27;m pretty sure it won&#x27;t match the tremendously superb
re-telling in &lt;em&gt;The New World&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. That&#x27;s a movie in which we are blessed
with amazing story-telling, aided by amazing editing, costume design,
and characterisation (the immeasurably-rich native behavioral customs
which probably exceeds that of the &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;apocalypto-2006&quot;&gt;Apocalypto&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;; the struggling white
inhabitants and especially the kids).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gal playing &lt;em&gt;Pocahontas&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; must have been quite a search, given that
she&#x27;s so perfect and gorgeous and all that shit. Collin Farrell, who
helped me undermine the movie on first appearance, does manage to pull
quite a decent performance too.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I only realised this was Pocahontas when shown on the end-credits. Yeah,
I watched the movie almost by accident. That it is romance made me
worry, since it&#x27;s hard to find good ones. It doesn&#x27;t disappoint in
that department, and the courtship moments are just about unbeatable.
It&#x27;s like paradise.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;What I saw in &lt;em&gt;Step Up 2: The Streets&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is among the best hip-hop dancing
I&#x27;ve seen yet, which brings it to the level of &lt;em&gt;Rize&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. The movie is
also populated with a variety of interesting characters (bar some).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was repeatedly fascinated by the short moment of the sexual
interaction between the black couple, not to mention the hotness of the
black girl, all in the old-fashioned actioner named &lt;em&gt;The Condemned&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was not going to mention &lt;em&gt;Mirrors&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, but the ending alone makes it
worth a look. Make-up (or whatever it is that achieved the imagery of
the woman whose skin was melting) is top-class while the lady playing
wife just sucks, much more than the unconvincing &#x27;first&#x27; victim.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Smart dialog can be found in &lt;em&gt;The Squid &amp;amp; the Whale&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, which portrays an
ordinary story of a troubled and divorcing family, complete with
gorgeous performances (except I would have preferred Anna Paquin&#x27;s
absence). It&#x27;s a strong character study, dominated by the harsh&#x2F;cold,
naive, idiotic (yet beloved and intelligent) older son, trying too hard
to impress and support a shitty-ass asshole of a father, while all
that&#x27;s wrong with the world is blamed on the mother. One wishes a good
number of families get to witness such beauty and introspect selves,
&#x27;cuz what the family goes through is serious crisis.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3:10 To Yuma was lesser than I expected while Jason Statham is the least
of the qualities of the beautifully-shot and exciting The Bank Job. At
the same time, there&#x27;s way too much wizardry and dodgy martial atristry
in the disorganised mess that is Swordsman, and I discovered the elastic
master from &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;kung-fu-hustle-2004&quot;&gt;Kung Fu Hustle&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; in there, and he didn&#x27;t help at all.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;A really good drama can be found in the very engaging (and painful)
House of Sand and Fog, which also got Ben Kingsley providing quite a
performance. It also got beautiful camerawork and sets in places, and
beautiful women too.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wild Hogs is a fine movie with a fresh storyline (though City Slickers
had a similar concept), but it appears its creators didn&#x27;t really know
how to run with the story, specially with an ending that don&#x27;t do it
justice; William H. Macy is pure bliss.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was quite surprised that it was John Lequizamo playing the delightful
villain in Spawn, being the real center of the movie and is about its
only saviour. The guy really is talented and helps the movie get
bearable. It was perhaps 10 years back when I first watched, and even
was unsatisfied especially by Satan, and then by Martin Sheen as a very
miscast villain. It&#x27;s a very bad movie.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that attracted me to Closer is Mike Nichol&#x27;s attachment as
director and he here crafts a movie of gorgeous sets and camerawork
armed with a fresh and original storyline, albeit depressing.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good candidate for the ultimate &#x27;girl power&#x27; movie is &lt;em&gt;The Descent&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;,
even though I don&#x27;t see the point of its subplot of a woman losing her
family; And the creatures look like those from &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;i-am-legend&quot;&gt;I Am Legend&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.
Incidentally Rodriguez also got a kick-ass, gun-&#x27;carrying&#x27; gal in a
beautifully crafted but nonsensical &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;planet-terror-2007&quot;&gt;Planet Terror&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <pubDate>Sun, 12 Oct 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

                <description>&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s strange that Spike Lee covered 2 issues, cheating and racism, in a
single movie, and none reduced to a subplot. What&#x27;s also strange is
that there&#x27;s little to celebrate in this tired and ageing &lt;em&gt;Jungle
Fever&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; (given Lee&#x27;s amazing credentials), although the scene where the
protagonist resigns is commendable. Another strange thing is it was the
first time I saw this piece of shit, old and popular as it is.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also don&#x27;t like the fact that someone(s) claimed that &lt;em&gt;TransAmerica&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
is excellent. Sure we don&#x27;t get much movie coverage of transgender
issues, but I hate it when artistic prowess is ignored in favour of
politics when judging excellence. By the way I became surprised that the
protagonist was played by a woman.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It always is a pleasure watching the lead villain of the &lt;em&gt;Saw&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; movie
series, which really pushes the boundaries as regards
unbearably-explicit gore, but most importantly, a rather fresh and
powerful premise (having individuals choose between separate ghastly
ends, one of which leads to survival). I even feel that he outdoes
himself here in the fourth installment, which unfortunately feels
hurried while also employing excessive use of editing to enhance certain
scenes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The supporting cast of &lt;em&gt;Room 1408&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; did quite a commendable job, most
notably Alexandra Silber&#x27;s turn as a fan of one of the author&#x27;s work.
Even Samuel L. Jackson isn&#x27;t annoying as usual, but I wish the movie&#x27;s
premise could have been explained better.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hellboy 2&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is far better than its predecessor and offers the sort of
creature extravaganza only last seen in the &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; series. Its
central concept is similar to that of &lt;em&gt;The Mummy 3&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; (awakening an
ancient and near-indestructible army) and I wonder if the writers were
aware. Luckily the material received better treament in this &lt;em&gt;Hellboy
2&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. And it&#x27;s also amazing that you can get such amazing martial arts
choreography in Yuen Woo Ping&#x27;s absence. Oh, and I couldn&#x27;t help but
notice that the walking fish is modeled after that talkative robot in
&lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. It&#x27;s also obvious that some (at least one) of the creature
designs were inspired by childkiller from &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;pan-s-labyrinth-2006&quot;&gt;Pan&#x27;s Labyrinth&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and much
of the designs look childish and unconvincing.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R. Lee Ermey doesn&#x27;t miss a step in the bad and unnecessary horror
flick, &lt;em&gt;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One movie that should be forbidden from the eyes of all is &lt;em&gt;The
Forbidden Kingdom&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, even though I &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;recent-movies-2008-05-28&quot;&gt;enjoyed it more previously&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <pubDate>Sat, 04 Oct 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/good-dark-knight-review/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;I just read &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ruthlessreviews.com&#x2F;742&#x2F;dark-knight-the&quot;&gt;a real good Dark Knight review&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, which does a good job of
explaining the complex topic(s) the movie attempts as well as the superb
The Joker, in better words &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-dark-knight-2008&quot;&gt;than I could manage&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps equally good is &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ruthlessreviews.com&#x2F;746&#x2F;dark-knight-the-2&quot;&gt;a hater review&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; from the same publication, and
happens to be more quotable:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a pulp experience that goes on and on and on, with the tired
assumption that length connotes depth, and somber tones +++ and the
occasional cackle +++ inject relevance and insight into an
adolescent&#x27;s approach to morality and ethics.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That quotable review by the way got comments which really deserves
checking out, and among my favorites:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing that ruined the movie for me was all that impenetrable
jingoistic bullshit about who was a hero and who needs a hero and what
kind of hero, and who gives a shit? That and the bullshit about the
noble people not blowing each other up. Both boats would have blown up
at once with everybody diving for the trigger, yelling, &amp;quot;Me first!
Fuck you!&amp;quot; Just like the Joker thought. What a lousy move for a great
character to get stuck in.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Kurt Russel gives a good performance, and I don&#x27;t remember enjoying any
of his others. Quentin Tarantino reprises the style he used so well in
&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;300-the-visual-masterpiece-pulp-fiction-the-ex-masterpiece&quot;&gt;Pulp Fiction&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;: lengthy and pointless dialogues that mostly do nothing
to serve the story (and deliberately so I suspect), but nevertheless
interesting, and perhaps the one thing that made people fall in love
with this master-director.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cast of the first of the 2 stories found in Death Proof is top-rate
and the handling of the material helps the piece feel real fresh. Oh,
and it also got the best (and most gruesome) car crash in recent memory.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Like &lt;em&gt;Morvern Callar&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-war-zone-1999&quot;&gt;The War Zone&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Machinist&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; got nearly
nothing going on as regards plot (the meditative sort that never aids
the movie to be a blockbuster) as well as skillful direction and acting;
The two relationships formed by our lead in &lt;em&gt;The Machinist&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; are really
touching, and our lead, Christopher Bale, deserves great respect for
losing all that weight for the role.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember Katie Holmes being the worst thing in &lt;em&gt;Batman Begins&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, but I
got pleasantly surprised by her enjoyable performance in &lt;em&gt;Mad Money&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, a
very enjoyable and light-hearted comedy, with a good story.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did not expect much from Chris Rock&#x27;s &lt;em&gt;I Think I Love My Wife&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; but
got surprised since it truly is fun with a real decent cast and the
best-of-career performance by the Kerry Washington&#x27;s slutty, yet
beloved character. Sadly, there&#x27;s the usual formula, the movie seems
real pointless, and the ending exposes a hole (or two).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pulse&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; got David Fincher&#x27;s atmospherics but lacks his near-perfect
execution. I liked the counterfeiter&#x27;s portrayal.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cuba Gooding, jnr gives a very good performance in &lt;em&gt;Dirty&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; when playing
a careless and near-corrupt police officer, and a performance similar to
his other excellent turn as an intoxicated club owner in &lt;em&gt;American
Gangster&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. Nearly everyone else turns quite impressive, and that does
not include the movie&#x27;s lead character.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mummy 3&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is easily the worst of the series despite me having vague
memories of those other forgettable movies. Anything that&#x27;s ancient
China truly excites me and we here see wasted opportunities, and the
movie is treated like children&#x27;s stuff. Two things however deserve
acknowledgement - the hyper-realistic mountain creatures and the
end-credits sequence (obviously inspired and superior to &lt;em&gt;300&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&#x27;s). I
like the scar-faced lady too, all angry, unflinching, and gorgeous, but
is wasted too. And I don&#x27;t recall Jet Li being so evil since &lt;em&gt;Lethal
Weapon 4&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, and he don&#x27;t fit too well. It&#x27;s a bad movie.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arthur &amp;amp; the Invisibles&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is a silly, childish story that does not do
justice to some nice and powerful concepts (the villain - who got quite
a presence and is a display of genius character design - is the movie&#x27;s
most interesting thing but is only hinted at; the legend of the 7
kingdoms is also merely mentioned and left largely unexplained).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A revisit of &lt;em&gt;Braveheart&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; left me less than impressed, which is
unfortunate considering that this was my personal best for a number of
years, until it was of course toppled by the still-unbeaten &lt;em&gt;Fight
Club&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Less-than-average attempt to capture the life of an Apartheid-era
freedom fighter, none of whose performances deserve any honor and
Williams, the movie&#x27;s villain, really disgusts, and Bonnie Mbuli (or
whatever the fuck her new surname, and I wonder why the fuck ladies
change surnames when getting married) has done much better before, and
actually to a point where I considered her the cream of young SA talent
(she was easily the best actor in the deservedly now-defunct e.tv
soapie, Backstage).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As in any political movie, I suppose the story&#x2F;message is supposed to be
more important than the technicalities. I&#x27;ve seen better SA political
stuff like Mapantsula (special because the protagonist didn&#x27;t give no
shit about &#x27;the struggle&#x27; yet emerged a key character) or even the
over-celebrated Sarafina. Off the top of my head, that&#x27;s all I remember
as far as SA political movies go, a small piece of this most poor of
movie industries. SA makes among the best ever TV advertisements and
even some decent music videos and at least one supreme drama series
(Yizo Yizo) but is yet to really venture into movies, never mind make a
masterpiece. Tsotsi can&#x27;t count for I don&#x27;t know how much the bribery
was, cuz, though it ain&#x27;t shit, it also can&#x27;t win any award at all,
except maybe for cinematography or so.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lookout&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; has got the year&#x27;s worst fuck-up so far. How could one
provide a great script, cast and cinematography and then fuck it up with
B-grade action and a shitty ass ending? I also wonder what&#x27;s up with a
completely unneeded broody guy in sunglasses, reminiscent of the equally
annoying guy in &lt;em&gt;Scarface&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, the one that delivers the last shot onto the
Al Pacino character. Oh, and the pussy-shoving whore also simply
disappeared without an explanation. Something must have gone seriously
wrong during production.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I pretty much enjoyed the popcorn biking movie, &lt;em&gt;Torque&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, despite being
spoiled by its fantasy elements, more suited to a &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;final-fantasy-vii-advent-children-2005&quot;&gt;Final Fantasy VII&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.
The level of fantasy should have a limit, depending on the situation.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#x27;s good acting from the two leads of &lt;em&gt;Vacancy&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, a well-made horror
movie about sickos murdering motel visitors on camera.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shooter&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; was as exciting as I expected but was full of uncomfortable
formula; there aren&#x27;t too many sniper movies out there but this is
probably the most effective; the movie is in the spirit of the &lt;em&gt;Bourne&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
trilogy.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A revisit of &lt;em&gt;Robots&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; didn&#x27;t do much to diminish the genious creativity
behind it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;John Leguizamo is among the most intense of actors (see &lt;em&gt;Summer of Sam&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;)
and it&#x27;s really impressive that he&#x27;s just as skilled in comedy too. I
remember his amazing turn appearance as a dwarf in &lt;em&gt;Moulin Rouge&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, but
why I write about him is his performance in a childish fable,
&lt;em&gt;Honeymooners&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, where he got no match, even though the movie&#x27;s funniest
moment is Cedric the Entertainer&#x27;s cayenne pepper moment, possibly the
year&#x27;s funniest so far.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#x27;t quite know what to make of &lt;em&gt;Boiler Room&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, except that it&#x27;s
pretty exciting with powerful performances from Vin Diesel and
especially Ben Affleck, and an especially superb one from Tom Everett
Scott as company boss. The initial scene, displaying the excited
employees, is classic.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Something New&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is quite a delight really with gorgeous shots and an
unfortunately standard romantic movie moments (the break-up, the
get-back-together, and other shitty moments). Anyways, the story&#x27;s
about a brain-damaged woman who gets healed by a perfect man. Some race
issues get raised and luckily aren&#x27;t preached, even feeling fresh at
that.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;To someone uninitiated with the technicalities of 3D animation, Big Buck
Bunny is a serious let-down. The 8-minute clip looks unfinished and with
inconsistent detail and quality in various shots as well as boring and
overly-simplistic storyline, far lesser than the worst episode of its
possible inspiration, the legendary Bugs Bunny cartoons. There&#x27;s not a
single moment where I stopped and admired anything. This wasn&#x27;t a case
with the previous project, Elephants Dream, which had quite a few
breathtaking moments (opening sequence displaying a layer of water on a
decaying and brownish surface, the scene after that displaying the 2
characters on some bridge, the scene of the moving wall, etc.) and
superb fantasy concepts (the not-so-smooth elevator, the &#x27;living&#x27;
steps from nowhere).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;strong&gt;sidenote&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;] Someone I showed the 2 clips pointed technical
superiority Big Buck Bunny, specifically the facial expressions and
especially the grass movement caused by the wind. At least he agrees
with me which is a superior achievement overall.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <title>Why Did I Watch This Crap?</title>
                <pubDate>Wed, 04 Jun 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
                <link>http://tshepang.net/why-did-i-watch-this-crap/</link>
                <guid>http://tshepang.net/why-did-i-watch-this-crap/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Why did I watch Why Did I Get Married? To answer the question, it was
mostly out of curiosity really, and that&#x27;s because it proved a hit
among female Black folk.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why I wasn&#x27;t interested in from the onset is because I expected sobby
and formulaic non-sense and that wasn&#x27;t helped much by a history of
shitty Black American romance (which normally went straight to video).
Well it turned much worse that i expected actually with a dumb and
amateurish script and disgustingly-bad performances, especially from
Jill Scott, that very same individual who took part in what I&#x27;m tempted
to call the best modern RnB album ever, Who&#x27;s Jill Scott. What of Janet
Jackson in a performance much lesser than that she gave in Poetic
Justice? And I kept wondering what&#x27;s up with the constant preaching
about God&#x27;s love and shit like that. Why shitty ass dialogue like this
ever sees the big screen truly is mysterious!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More Black American shit can be found in the other popular romance, Love
&amp;amp; Basketball, which feels like a bad sitcom, but with worse lighting and
script; it was a bit shocking to find that Spike Lee was involved, as
co-producer.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Me being a big sucker for martial arts shows, especially when it gets as
exotic as having 2 near-invincible monks strutting their stuff in
ancient China, what can I do but marvel? Jackie Chan manages to remain
interesting (unlike in his other disgusting efforts) while Jet Li is
about as cool as ever, although the movie tends to be too childish and
playful, which spoils it all. The biggest fuck-up however is the
appearance of the American teenager, the same-old fuck-up that is so
common, where you only wanna see Orientals, &#x27;cuz Caucasians just don&#x27;t
fit in this sort of environment, making it feel cheap&#x2F;fake; and despite
that this teenager don&#x27;t have no previous experience, he still manages
to stand his own against supposedly-professional soldiers; I haven&#x27;t
mentioned the lack of acting skill. I have here been talking of the
long-awaited Jet Li&#x2F;Jackie Chan collaboration named The Forbidden
Kingdom. [&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;recent-movies-2008-10-12&quot;&gt;update&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hard Candy&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is intense with an edgy feel to it, and features 2
highly-dedicated performances, a well-written dialogue, and got the
earliest ever twist of any movie I&#x27;ve seen.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Basic Instinct has nothing of value to say and there&#x27;s no way the
scriptwriter thought she did a good job, unless something got really
fucked during production. It&#x27;s even worse than the rather entertaining
and overly passive Are We There Yet, if for no reason but those charming
kids.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#x27;s much to celebrate in 2 Weeks&#x27; Notice, perhaps the first movie
in which I enjoyed Sandra Bullock&#x27;s peformance. It actually a pretty
smart movie, among the few romantic comedies I enjoyed, but, as could be
expected from such fare, a really fucked-up and overly-common ending.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best of this bunch happens to be Hairspray, a carefully-made
anti-prejudice movie, perhaps the most enchanting movie that ever
attempted such a subject. Special note goes to John Travolta who gives
the movie&#x27;s most delightful performance, despite also taking part in
its dullest moment, that in which she dances with the husband character
played by Christopher Walken, who himself is taking uninteresting roles
as time passes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s hard to believe that some people are still interested in the Diana
story, but I found &lt;em&gt;The Queen&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; to possess exquisite camerawork and
production design, the elements that the boring &lt;em&gt;Possession&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; possesses.
Luckily, I had the pleasure of seeing &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;iron-man&quot;&gt;Iron Man&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, which is a superb
crowd-pleaser. And I really love the design of the metal suit.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I find the effort to remake &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;seven-samurai-1954&quot;&gt;Seven Samurai&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; into a western, &lt;em&gt;The

formidable that it makes the remake laughable or disgusting actually +++
compare the wise old man for example, or worse, the young wannabe

&lt;p&gt;I found &lt;em&gt;The Brave One&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; highly entertaining, and superbly-made, complete
with wonderful sound and a great lead performance by Jodie Foster; I
would have benefited from a better title, and it could have done without
the friendship between the vigilante and the cop, which results in some
unfortunate sugar-coating, detracting from the movie&#x27;s tough approach.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;The Hunted does a great job on engaging me in a way reminiscent of
&lt;em&gt;Bourne Identity&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; trilogy given its intensity and edge-of-the-seat
excitement as well as hyper-capable lead characters, and these leads
(Benicio Del Toro and Tommy Lee Jones) provide top-class acts. By the
way, the fight sequences are beyond any I&#x27;ve seen, bar oriental martial
arts stuff.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Watching Mickey Rourke&#x27;s character as he goes on violently
investigating the murder of his beloved Goldie never stops getting me
excited. Easily the best of Sin City&#x27;s stories, &amp;quot;The Hard Goodbye&amp;quot; is
made great by the guy&#x27;s humour (as he narrates), the
imaginatively-illustrated, cartoony action, not to mention his
super-human strength (and I&#x27;m a sucker for the beyond-real).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kaena: The Prophecy&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; has an obvious influence on &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;beowulf-2007&quot;&gt;Beowulf&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; regarding
the visual design of the arch-villain and its environment. It got its
breath-taking moments but is largely boring and feels over-long at a
mere 90-minutes (it feels like a TV series).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Running Scared&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, flashy as it is, remains a sort of wannabe &lt;em&gt;Lucky

moments.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The confrontation between Craig Bierko&#x27;s and Russel Crowe&#x27;s characters
is fun to watch in &lt;em&gt;Cinderella Man&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. For some reason, I expected it to
be a challenging movie, but it&#x27;s actually just another,
edge-of-your-seat sports movie. At least it made me feel lucky that I
wasn&#x27;t in the US during the Great Depression.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Watching the bonus features on the DVD of &lt;em&gt;Pirates of the Caribbean 3:
At World&#x27;s End&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; alerted me to the movie&#x27;s major fuck-up, the absence
of a brand-new immortal crew. The first won because the skeletal crew
rocked hard, and the second won because of Davey Jones and crew. As for
this one, we are given the unexciting sea-storm as the star. By the way,
the first scene which &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;pirates-of-the-caribbean-3&quot;&gt;I once praised&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, doesn&#x27;t pack quite as much a
punch as when I saw it first time around.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;The history and origin of the jumpers of &lt;em&gt;Jumper&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; would have been fun,
but instead some seemingly hurried producers&#x2F;editors decided to reduce
it to mere passing mention... I could have done with a better villain,
fearsome as Jackson was.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Stanley Tucci is wonderful in &lt;em&gt;The Devil Wears Prada&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, a movie which
also got the honor of perhaps being the first movie that showed me the
workings of the fashion industry, a foreign world to me.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Magnolia&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;recent-movies-2007-11-05&quot;&gt;isn&#x27;t really a good movie&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, but is much better than
&lt;em&gt;Crash&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, which got the same theme of multiple characters involved in
very strange and random circumstances, though the latter also gets
loud-mouthed about the whole racism issue, which don&#x27;t work if not
handled well.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The King&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is the best of this bunch even though the ending don&#x27;t seem
well-justified, and is left unexplained, and I wish there should have
been a better lead, while William Hurt provides a really good
performance. By the way, this it happens to be the first movie I&#x27;ve
seen that touches on Intelligent Design.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <title>&#x27;Cloverfield&#x27; vs. &#x27;I Am Legend&#x27;</title>
                <pubDate>Sun, 17 Feb 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
                <link>http://tshepang.net/cloverfield-vs-i-am-legend/</link>
                <guid>http://tshepang.net/cloverfield-vs-i-am-legend/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;I was very impressed with Cloverfield which is an experience so far this
year matched only by &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;i-am-legend&quot;&gt;I Am Legend&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. It got a truly innovative
storytelling approach, and that at a time when my skeptic mind wonders
if Hollywood got something fresh for us. It also possesses superb sound,
and a superb creature&#x2F;super-Godzilla.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie is similar to &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;i-am-legend&quot;&gt;I Am Legend&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; &#x27;cuz:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;both got conservative use of action visual effects (though more so
here since we are only given brief views of the fabulous monster)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the visual effects of both movies are seemingly flawless&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;both are disaster&#x2F;horror movies set in New York&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;by the time the end-credits roll, one is left salivating for more&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As to which is superior, I&#x27;d vote &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;i-am-legend&quot;&gt;I Am Legend&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; since &lt;em&gt;Cloverfield&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; got
some annoyingly unrealistic sequences, which is a pity considering how
the movie is presented. That Cloverfield weakness is however more than
well-compensated by the wonderful acting and direction, all pretty
realistic, and that&#x27;s before the unnamed monster begins its rampage.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;A recent revisit of &lt;em&gt;Matchstick Men&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; was a let-down since I enjoyed it
much on the first viewing, especially given its heavy-weight twist, the
very twist that spoils a revisit. Nicolas Cage&#x27;s retarded character
lost its appeal too.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/ugly-european-cities/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently saw Ronin, whose non-glossy action reminds me of the 70&#x27;s
action movies, and which is set in Europe, reminding me of the Bourne
trilogy. More notable is these movies show how ugly European cities are,
not to mention for example the police uniforms and police cars, perhaps
because I&#x27;ve been conditioned to the American look. And that Ronin
ain&#x27;t so bad, but it&#x27;s just not memorable.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/recent-movies-2008-02-07/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;The strange thing about the &lt;em&gt;Three Colours&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; trilogy is that it feels the
films are made by different directors, even though they all carry the
same themes of individuals made unhappy due to love, making one feel
glad not existing in the character&#x27;s lives. Another common element is
the presence of strong secondary characters; in the case of &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;recent-movies-2007-11-05&quot;&gt;Three
Colours Blue&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, the first and best, we get a strip dancer, in the case of
&lt;em&gt;Three Colours White&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, the least interesting, we get a well-off stranger
who meets the protagonist on a train station, and in the case of &lt;em&gt;Three
Colours Red&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, we get a lonely retired judge who is perhaps given greater
presence than all the others.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This trilogy of tragic stories is a little overrated because, though
good movies, they are pretty much like experimental portrayals, the sort
that would attract minimal audience interest.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Curse of the Golden flower&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is Zhang Yimou&#x27;s worst movie I&#x27;ve
seen yet, for , besides being really boring, also happens to have a
whole bunch of bad (the three brothers) and unbearable (Gong Li)
performances and a shitty-ass and very unsatisfying storyline, leaving
me wondering what the point was. The visuals were overdone, leaving the
movie looking cartoonish. Luckily we had a wonderful performance by the
gorgeous ninja lady (whose identity I&#x27;m lazy to find).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I don&#x27;t remember seeing vampires as well-realised as in &lt;em&gt;30 Days of
Night&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, and the heroic and suicidal scene, where a secondary character
saves the lead&#x27;s life (for the second time actually), is tough to beat.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taraji Hanson won &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;2007-movie-review&quot;&gt;2007 performance of the year&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and repeats her sass in
&lt;em&gt;Talk To Me&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; in a much bigger role, though not with as much impact,
though remaining impressive still.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <title>Transformers (2007)</title>
                <pubDate>Tue, 15 Jan 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
                <link>http://tshepang.net/transformers-2007/</link>
                <guid>http://tshepang.net/transformers-2007/</guid>
                <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;first-review-2007&quot;&gt;first review (2007)&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After watching this spectacle, the greatest so far this year, I kept
wondering which has superior visual effects if compared to &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;pirates-of-the-caribbean-3&quot;&gt;Pirates of
the Caribbean 3&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. It wins in terms of spectacle due to the far larger
activity going on all over the screen and it&#x27;s really unbelieavable how
seemingly no cash was spared, and it&#x27;s only since King Kong (2005) have
I been so overwhelmed by sheer size. Interestingly, I can&#x27;t single out
a favorite effect because they are all over the place (the scorpion
battle, the city battle, the transformers).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lead performer is quite impressive and so is the mother, who
provides among the movie&#x27;s finest comic moments.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily the movie isn&#x27;t pretentious (say the ridiculous &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;spider-man-3-2007&quot;&gt;Spider-Man 3&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;)
about its seriousness, feeling like a mere crowd-pleaser, and what a
crowd-pleaser it is! This fact allows one to enjoy it pretty well,
disregarding plot-holes and other deficiencies.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;second-review-2008&quot;&gt;second review (2008)&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This revisit turned into a frustrating exercise since I noted too many
compositing errors, unimpressive production design (especially for such
an expensive movie), worse cinematography (unbearable and overdone
lighting), and cardboard characters, none being believable. This is not
even mentioning some really bad casting choices (Anthony Anderson
playing the best computer cracker; the entire heroic soldier crew).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transformations are overwhelming (as if that&#x27;s supposed to be an
advantage) and there&#x27;s way more action than necessary... I could not
keep up. Worse still, none of it is believable (e.g. we get our nerdy
hero getting serious physical pounding without getting hurt, or acting
all calm while a multi-ton machine falls very close-by).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, the entire concept is god-damn silly, but then &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
managed to get away with its own silly concept (machines &#x27;farming&#x27;
human energy... WTF!) by being better elsewhere.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
                <link>http://tshepang.net/2007-movie-review/</link>
                <guid>http://tshepang.net/2007-movie-review/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Not such a good year at the movies if compared to &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;2005-movie-review&quot;&gt;2005&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;2006-movie-review&quot;&gt;2006&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and
there&#x27;s isn&#x27;t even a single masterpiece.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;movie-of-the-year&quot;&gt;movie of the year&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing this year has had as much impact on me as has Mel Gibson&#x27;s
&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;apocalypto-2006&quot;&gt;Apocalypto&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; given its gruelling tale of cruelty, the sort I never
witnessed before. The runner-up is &lt;em&gt;300&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; for its awe-inspiring visual
magnificence.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;best-movie-of-the-year&quot;&gt;best movie of the year&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a number of very well-made movies this year, but none was as
good as &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;smokin-aces-2006&quot;&gt;Smokin&#x27; Aces&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for its exciting action and excellent direction.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;enchanting&quot;&gt;enchanting&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Polar Express&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; was made a number of years ago but it still packs a
punch in many of its moments especially the near-accident of the magic
train, the dance sequence of chocolate presentation, and the North pole
environment. These are possibly the most magical ever sequences in movie
history. &lt;em&gt;Ratatouille&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, another fantasy, is a very enjoyable runner-up,
even given its formulaic touches, typical of so much animation out
there.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;cinematography&quot;&gt;cinematography&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;munich-2005&quot;&gt;Munich&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; can&#x27;t be beaten in this category for its flawlessly-polished
look. It is followed by a much smaller movie, &lt;em&gt;Three Colours Blue&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, for
its beautiful usage of lighting.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;production-design&quot;&gt;production design&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s rare that an old movie would impress this much due to its visual
aspects, but the design of the alien environment in &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; was
breath-taking. The runner-up happened to be &lt;em&gt;District B13&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; for its
rotting and crime-ridden urban setting.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;cast&quot;&gt;cast&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What helped make &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;apocalypto-2006&quot;&gt;Apocalypto&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; feel so real is its cast of unknowns; I
did not notice any misplacement or annoying performance. The runner-up
is the cast of &lt;em&gt;American Ganster&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; (and that does not include the two
leads). &lt;em&gt;Hot Fuzz&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; wins the title for comic cast.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;performances&quot;&gt;performances&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My most favorite of all the year&#x27;s performances goes to Taraji Henson
who plays an exciting, yet heartbreaking, role of a sniper in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;smokin-aces-2006&quot;&gt;Smokin&#x27;
Aces&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. The best female performance was however that of Anne Parillaud,
who plays the lead in &lt;em&gt;Sex is Comedy&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, portraying a tough yet lovely
movie director. The performance is enhanced very well by her limp. As
for male performances, there&#x27;s a tie between Anthony Hopkins in
&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;fracture-2007&quot;&gt;Fracture&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and Forest Whitaker in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-last-king-of-scotland-2006&quot;&gt;The Last King of Scotland&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, which is
a pity because that was Forest&#x27;s best ever performance while Anthony&#x27;s
was business-as-usual. Mark Ruffalo&#x27;s subdued but highly-focused
character in &lt;em&gt;Zodiac&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is runner-up.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;characters&quot;&gt;characters&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best villain is Josh Brolin&#x27;s dirty cop found in &lt;em&gt;American Ganster&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
for its unflinching acts of corruption. My favorite character is Gerard
Butler&#x27;s Spartan king in &lt;em&gt;300&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; while the most exotic is the Angelina
Jolie&#x27;s demon in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;beowulf-2007&quot;&gt;Beowulf&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. The most desirable gal is Rosamund Pike in
&lt;em&gt;Fracture&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; while Vera Farmica of &lt;em&gt;The Departed&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, Ana Claudia Talancon&#x27;
in &lt;em&gt;El Crimen del Padro Amaro&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, and Kerry Washington in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-last-king-of-scotland-2006&quot;&gt;The Last King
of Scotland&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; are tied as runner-ups. Julianne Moore in &lt;em&gt;Next&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is the
year&#x27;s best detective given her unrelenting focus in getting the job
done. A special mention should go to John Heder&#x27;s goofy and
kind-hearted ice skating champion in the delightful &lt;em&gt;Blades of Glory&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.
The &lt;strong&gt;best character design&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is the child-killing, pale monster in
&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;pan-s-labyrinth-2006&quot;&gt;Pan&#x27;s Labyrinth&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;visuals&quot;&gt;visuals&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The year&#x27;s greatest spectacle &lt;em&gt;Transformers&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is also the year&#x27;s best
visual effects showcase, and should have tied with the runner-up,
&lt;em&gt;Pirates of the Caribbean - At World&#x27;s End&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, had it not been so
exciting. That runner-up would have won had it come up with something
more interesting than the stormy battle. &lt;em&gt;300&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; easily wins the year&#x27;s
best imagery&#x2F;visual design, and &lt;em&gt;The Number 23&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; takes second spot due to
its gorgeous fantasy-like scenes. The most horrific&#x2F;shocking imagery
emanates from &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-last-king-of-scotland-2006&quot;&gt;The Last King of Scotland&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, a scene that showcases the
aftermath of the cheating wife.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;action&quot;&gt;action&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best action of any movie this year emanates from the gripping &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-bourne-ultimatum-2007&quot;&gt;The
Bourne Ultimatum&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, given its excellent execution and the relentless
dedication of the Bourne character, and his lead adversary. The best
action sequence is however to be found in the final battle in &lt;em&gt;The
Kingdom&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. The best chase sequence is to be found in the very first scene
of &lt;em&gt;District B13&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, where the very athletic hero saves his neck from some
very unloving fellows.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;munich-2005&quot;&gt;Munich&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; ties with &lt;em&gt;Cars&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; as regards the best sound. There&#x27;s a tie
between &lt;em&gt;The Number 23&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Lucky Number Slevin&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; (presentation of
textual info and the slick murders) as the best opening credits
sequence. The runner-up is &lt;em&gt;The Kingdom&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, while the best closing credits
is by &lt;em&gt;300&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, with its nice mix of 2D and 3D imagery. &lt;em&gt;Next&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; wins both
most romantic scene (the definition of beauty) and most painful scene
(wheelchair explosion) even though both their impact was painfully
reduced on a revisit. The movie also offers best concept (seeing the
future in a mere 2 minutes). Runner-up happens to be &lt;em&gt;Solaris&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, whose
concept is reminiscent of that of &lt;em&gt;Sphere&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and therefore not so fresh.
&lt;em&gt;Solaris&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is also runner-up for most surreal, winner by far being the
unbearably weird &lt;em&gt;The Fountain&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-last-king-of-scotland-2006&quot;&gt;The Last King of Scotland&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; had the
best music, &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;apocalypto-2006&quot;&gt;Apocalypto&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; had the best costume design, and &lt;em&gt;Five Fingers&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
had the best twist. The most overrated movie turns out to be &lt;em&gt;Vertigo&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;,
which frequently appears in many elevated lists of the all-time greatest
movies. Instead of a landmark, I saw a badly-acted old-time thriller,
not a bit better than those Humphrey Bogart flicks. The runner-up is
&lt;em&gt;The Searchers&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; which lacked anything commendable, bar some nice images
during the final battle.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;special-mention&quot;&gt;special mention&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something like &lt;em&gt;Alpha Dog&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; has not quite been done before and therefore
maintains amazing levels of freshness given various moments (the angry
telephone call, Justin Timberlake&#x27;s cool) even though it remains
pointless. Another special mention should go to &lt;em&gt;Devil&#x27;s Rejects&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; for
its crazy storyline of killers-for-fun and gruesome violence,
reminiscent of &lt;em&gt;Natural Born Killers&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;best-first-time-viewing-experiences&quot;&gt;best first-time viewing experiences&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As anyone knows and as seen many times above, movies never offer the
same experience when revisited. So here&#x27;s a listing of those which were
most impressive on first viewing in order of which had the most impact:
&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;apocalypto-2006&quot;&gt;Apocalypto&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Fearless&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;300&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Next&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;others&quot;&gt;others&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;

                <pubDate>Mon, 05 Nov 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/recent-movies-2007-11-05/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Three Colours Blue&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; showcases wonderful cinematography (among the
highlights, check the texture, lighting, and color on the lead
character&#x27;s bruised face in an early scene while in hospital, a work of
tremendous beauty, with subtle colors, without resorting to overkill
fantasy-like eye-candy seen in &lt;em&gt;Amélie&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, another superb cinematography
showpiece; I also don&#x27;t have in memory such wonderful use focusing
which is also gentle) as well as excellent direction and acting; The
second encounter with dead man&#x27;s mistress brought tear to eye, the
moment where she states the widow&#x27;s nature.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I once considered &lt;em&gt;Magnolia&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; a masterpiece due to the fresh and original
storyline and the decent acting but the impact couldn&#x27;t last additional
revisits and that makes it the worst movie mentioned in this post. It
happens to be merely tedious with sub-standard dialogue and pretensions
of greatness.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cannot decide which is superior between &lt;em&gt;Scarface&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Underground&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.
The characters of the latter however are richer, while those of the
former are quite formulaic and not believable (wife, sister, mother) who
seem meant to seem essential, a matter of conformance. &lt;em&gt;Scarface&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
however has a more powerful storyline (exciting rise-and-fall story of a
crime lord) while &lt;em&gt;Underground&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, a dark comedy full of implausible
events, is totally eccentric, made interesting by its varied characters,
especially the romantic interest and the evil liar who later becomes an
esteemed politician. It&#x27;s interesting that the I found &lt;em&gt;Underground&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
too eccentric, and therefore irritating, but only after the first time
watching it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most enjoyable movie of this post is &lt;em&gt;Ray&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, due to its wonderful
music, interesting storyline and its lively editing. The character of
the lead is real fun to watch and skillfully portrayed too.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Scarface&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is what must have been an inspiration of the two dirty
cops in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;payback-1999&quot;&gt;Payback&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;; the dirty cop here wants a piece of action in return
for not arresting Al Pacino&#x27;s character same as those in &lt;em&gt;Payback&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.
Hilarious stuff actually.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <title>revisiting &#x27;Amadeus&#x27;</title>

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/revisiting-amadeus/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;The highlight of the movie is the narrator (played so well by F. Murray
Abraham, supported by great dialogue) in this enjoyable drama about
obsession and jealousy, themes balanced very well considering that the
lead character hates the very man he admires, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.
The praise this unfortunate character bestows upon Mozart&#x27;s genius is
unheard of in my movie memory.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately the fun ends right about the middle of the movie, turning
into a more sombre mood, partly because of (the beloved and
free-spirited) Mozart&#x27;s deterioration into alcohol and partying, and
partly because the narrator featured less.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <title>&#x27;Dr. Strangelove&#x27; vs. &#x27;Payback&#x27;</title>
                <pubDate>Tue, 23 Oct 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
                <link>http://tshepang.net/dr-strangelove-vs-payback/</link>
                <guid>http://tshepang.net/dr-strangelove-vs-payback/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;I have for a long time considered &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;dr-strangelove-1964&quot;&gt;Dr. Strangelove&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; as the best comedy
ever made, but on watching it yesterday, I actually wonder why it&#x27;s any
better than my beloved &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;payback-1999&quot;&gt;Payback&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Other than its pair of detectives,
&lt;em&gt;Payback&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; got a great villain (Kris Kristofferson in my most favorite of
his performances) and these are matched by &lt;em&gt;Dr. Strangelove&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&#x27;s mad
general (flawless performance by Sterling Hayden) and the gum-chewing
air force general (a rather overdone comic performance by George C.
Scott). &lt;em&gt;Dr. Strangelove&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; may have an edge since it&#x27;s actually a
brilliant satire while &lt;em&gt;Payback&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, well-written as it is, is at the end
just another exciting thriller, lacking dialogue as profound as that
provided by &lt;em&gt;Dr. Strangelove&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&#x27;s above-stated characters, and last and
least, the commander of the partly-damaged aircraft carrying nuclear
weapons. The verdict, developed during this post&#x27;s writing, sees
&lt;em&gt;Payback&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; as the lesser of the two.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sterling Hayden&#x27;s mad general must have inspired Kris Kristofferson&#x27;s
crime lord because their mannerisms are so much similar. Although to a
lesser extent, this also applies to George C. Scott&#x27;s general as
compared to Gregg Henry&#x27;s Val Resnick, the one who betrayed &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;payback-1999&quot;&gt;Payback&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
lead.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <title>the dramatic Jim Carrey</title>
                <pubDate>Tue, 11 Sep 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
                <link>http://tshepang.net/the-dramatic-jim-carrey/</link>
                <guid>http://tshepang.net/the-dramatic-jim-carrey/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently watched The Number 23 (gorgeously shot, especially the
imagination scenes) and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (very
original and disturbing) which led me to appreciate Jim Carrey&#x27;s talent
as an actor who plays the lead in both (It was a second viewing for the
latter).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Number 23 has better (excellent) direction but suffers later on as
the movie progresses from later drag as well as a lesser-than-superb
twist. It&#x27;s also reminiscent of a superior Pi whose main theme is also
around a number.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is the lesser of the two though
far more original. The movie&#x27;s most notable moment the admin girl&#x27;s
(Kirsten Dunst who at her finest) discovery (&lt;strong&gt;SPOILER ALERT&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;) of
previous erasure for the same &#x27;problem&#x27; she&#x27;s currently having. Of
lesser impact is also the moment when that same girl states a quote in
which the movie&#x27;s title is part.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <title>less-than-stellar revisits</title>
                <pubDate>Sun, 19 Aug 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
                <link>http://tshepang.net/less-than-stellar-revisits/</link>
                <guid>http://tshepang.net/less-than-stellar-revisits/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;I saw &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;300-the-visual-masterpiece-pulp-fiction-the-ex-masterpiece&quot;&gt;300&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; yesterday with the comments turned on and noticed numerous
compositing errors. These are however not as ridiculous as those of &lt;em&gt;The
Matrix Revolutions&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, which significantly lowers its visual effects
prowess, not to mention that the human-shaped robots weren&#x27;t so
impressive either, even though they still pack a punch. The movie
remains less-than-average, though more bearable than the last time I
checked.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for &lt;em&gt;300&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, it would be unfair to judge the movie itself due to the
reduced dramatic impact caused by the comments (and Zack Snyder, the
director, decided to turn the entire thing into a one-man show instead
of giving the other filmmakers, who were with him during the commentary,
a chance).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <pubDate>Fri, 20 Jul 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
                <link>http://tshepang.net/recent-movies-2007-07-20/</link>
                <guid>http://tshepang.net/recent-movies-2007-07-20/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;I was surprised to find Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon bearable in
their respective roles in the well-made &lt;em&gt;The Departed&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was disappointed that nothing impressive came out of &lt;em&gt;Shrek 3&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; (most
disgusting, besides the unbearable and uninspired script, is the poor
technical achievement whereby the characters don&#x27;t give no impression
of weight when actually walking). I never really liked the first
installment, and recognized the second as superior, partly due to the
colorful new characters, notably the lovely and yet evil magician lady
(mother of Prince Charming) and the cookie guy, among others. This third
is the worst, and Fionna is unbearably boring, as always when she&#x27;s her
green self.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Die Hard 4.0&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; seems among the biggest of all action movies ever,
rivalling Die Hard With A Vengeance (perhaps the ultimate of action
movies), Bad Boys 2, and True Lies. It&#x27;s interesting though that among
all the supreme set-pieces, notably the mosquito-plane attack and the
cracker elimination battle (which in the movie is unfortunately referred
to as hacker), the movie remains underwhelming. And Bruce Willis isn&#x27;t
aging too well either, losing the charms which were glowing in the
series&#x27; first and third installments (because the second sucked like
hell, or worse!).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder what fuss was up with &lt;em&gt;Borat&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, even though I enjoyed the dinner
scene (which was too short), and a few other moments.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shall I lose hope in the 007 franchise especially with &lt;em&gt;Casino Royale&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;,
the latest, among the least interesting in the 20+ entrant series. At
least it got nice, laid-back and black and white opening and not-so-bad
opening credits sequence.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <title>&#x27;Zodiac&#x27; and David Fincher</title>
                <pubDate>Wed, 04 Jul 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/zodiac-and-david-fincher/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;There&#x27;s no better movie director in my mind than David Fincher, an
honor granted due to his work in the excellent &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;se7en-1995&quot;&gt;Se7en&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and the
masterpiece, &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;fight-club-1999&quot;&gt;Fight Club&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; . He has made 4 other movies, most impressive
of which is &lt;em&gt;The Game&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Zodiac&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, his latest, has among the most complex
&lt;em&gt;storylines&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; in movie experience and I leave it unrated for I don&#x27;t
know what I can say about it, other than that I expected it to have been
treated with stylistic flair (as was the case with &lt;em&gt;Fight Club&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and
&lt;em&gt;Panic Room&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;), but Fincher decided to refrain.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One notable thing is Mark Ruffalo&#x27;s lead detective, the movie&#x27;s best
performance. It&#x27;s the kind of performance (vocal and physical) I&#x27;ve
never seen before.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s interesting to note that, before revisiting these two, I
considered them masterpieces, which is &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-case-of-the-matrix-reloaded&quot;&gt;the oft-occurring case of being
over-impressed by first-time viewings&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Office Space&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; impressed me
due to its intelligent script (which is not so prevalent anymore) and
Lola Rennt impressed me due to its innovative storytelling (which does
not taste so fresh anymore).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John C. McGinley provides the only interesting performance of his I&#x27;ve
yet seen in &lt;em&gt;Office Space&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I was years earlier excited by &lt;em&gt;Galaxy Quest&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and still enjoyed it
through this second viewing, though I don&#x27;t remember being this
irritated by characters who play the actors. The aliens are still
interesting, most especially the love-struck female one, and so is the
villain. Tim Allen was impressive in a scene in which he became ashamed
of self, and was interesting when having fun before realizing the
reality of the situation he is in. The visual effects are still okay,
most especially the vicious child-like creatures. The story idea remains
interesting too.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Phenomenon&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; amazed me years earlier for having such an exciting idea,
yet staying away from its abuse by staging the story in a rural area,
staying away from the glitz it could have seen. The movie skillfully
portrays the sort of unrest resulting from a surprising turn of events,
but unfortunately reduces community members to idiots.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <title>Philip Seymour Hoffman and &#x27;Capote&#x27;</title>

                <description>&lt;p&gt;In my search for the year&#x27;s masterpiece I went on and watched Philip
Seymour Hoffman&#x27;s celebrated performance playing the title character in
&lt;em&gt;Capote&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. It actually turned out to be his worst performance yet (I&#x27;ve
previously respected him for his great talent as well as playing
controversial characters) even if it has been honored with a best actor
Oscar. It was especially irritating perhaps because it looked so
artificial as if it was some comic characterisation of the factual
character he was playing.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie itself, though made with some skill, still falls short of
interesting and is made worse for its pretiousness. Directorial
decisions, like showing a near-breathtaking scene for longer than is
usual for movies, leads one into a false realisation that one is
watching something great, but nope, sorry. Sure the director got talent,
but he ought to go elsewhere to triumph from it, well at least for me.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I was surprised that &lt;em&gt;Die Hard&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, which I used to claim as a masterpiece,
is still engaging today, and that&#x27;s rare for any other movie that ever
was a childhood favorite. It probably is among the most influential ever
action movies and seems to have invented a few cliches of its own, like
the punching of some annoying character at the end of a movie or the
silly and noisy police chief (no research done on these). There&#x27;s loads
of good humor, some which is easily-missed (FBI having a laugh), and
some on the surface, like the amazing confidence those FBI agents
portray, not to mention the idiocy clearly shown by their silly faces.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite characters haven&#x27;t diminished their charm (the police who
repeatedly converses with the hero over CB radio, the limo driver, and
most notably, the computer cracker. Bruce Willis&#x27; shouldn&#x27;t be left
out either for his amazing charisma.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, together with the second sequel, &lt;em&gt;Die Hard With A Vengeance&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; as
well as &lt;em&gt;Predator&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, made me honor John McTiernan (who directed them) as
the greatest action movie director ever, and that honor should probably
stay there for there haven&#x27;t been much great action movies recently.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Bob Hoskins is not convincing in his villain role nor is Jet Li who is
even worse, playing a lowly man-child; Morgan is miscast. Fight
choreography is decent but the only really outstanding thing is the
charming Kerry Condon playing the ever-smiling daughter. I last saw this
one last year when released and it feels worse the second time around.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently revisited &lt;em&gt;The Fifth Element&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; (which I honored for its
eye-candy) and &lt;em&gt;The Boondock Saints&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; (which I honored for its stylistic
action and Willem Dafoe) and it&#x27;s a pity that the experience wasn&#x27;t so
pleasant. Both actually emerged as bad movies for their shallow
storylines with all appeal gone, except that The Boondock Saints&#x27;
Willem Dafoe remaines interesting.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <title>&#x27;Next&#x27; and &#x27;The Island&#x27;</title>
                <pubDate>Mon, 04 Jun 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
                <link>http://tshepang.net/next-and-the-island/</link>
                <guid>http://tshepang.net/next-and-the-island/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Next&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, an entertaining spectacle of the highest production standards.
It&#x27;s really well-made and got good acting from all participants,
especially Julianne Moore and Tory Kittles, the lead detective and her
sidekick. I just wish &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Thomas_Kretschmann&quot;&gt;Thomas Kretschmann&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; wasn&#x27;t there. He&#x27;s just not
interesting. At least not here.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#x27;s great but brief visual effects, great cinematography, and
production design. And there&#x27;s also the most romantic moment in movie
memory (&amp;quot;definition of beauty&amp;quot; scene which nearly soaked me in tears)
and the most painful moment so far this year (&amp;quot;explosive execution&amp;quot;
scene which nearly soaked me in tears, too). Such powerful emotions are
rare as are such movies, reminding me of the spectacular &lt;em&gt;The Island&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
(compelling, &amp;quot;never-before-told&amp;quot; storyline, superb action and visuals,
superb camerawork, beloved romantic interest, fearsome villains, ...).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should not neglect to credit Nicolas Cage for leading the entire cast
without a flaw, and it&#x27;s amazing that he still manages to maintain his
star after all these years. Also, in comparison with &lt;em&gt;The Island&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, he
gives a more interesting character than Ewan McGregor&#x27;s.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should also not neglect crediting &lt;em&gt;The Island&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; as a superior movie
for:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it got a better story (&lt;em&gt;Next&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&#x27;s nuclear bomb story is overkill, and
the villains&#x27; acts are left unjustified)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it&#x27;s a greater spectacle (nothing in &lt;em&gt;Next&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; beats its chase
sequence, though the falling debris comes close).&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One last note is that &lt;em&gt;Next&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; seems to have been inspired by David
Fincher&#x27;s &lt;em&gt;Se7en&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; (Fincher&#x27;s sort of beautiful, dark and brownish
camerawork, and the scene in which cars are coming from underground
parking, short in a hectic pace as in to signify the urgency of their
mission, and the upward-moving end-credits).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <title>Pirates of the Caribbean 3</title>
                <pubDate>Wed, 23 May 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
                <link>http://tshepang.net/pirates-of-the-caribbean-3/</link>
                <guid>http://tshepang.net/pirates-of-the-caribbean-3/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;A friend asked me of my experience of this spectacle and I could only
say that, albeit having many good elements, it was underwhelming +++ a
nice summary actually.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best thing in the entire trilogy was Davy Jones (as I have pointed
out &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;davey-jones-vs-kong&quot;&gt;before&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;), and he was so perfect in his first appearance that he
couldn&#x27;t be improved, and there is no new character introduced here
that is so appealing, nor any wow-factor element at all, denying the
movie any entry in the [visual effects spectacle][pointed] and movie
of the year lists. Sure the centerpiece of the movie raises bars, but
I&#x27;m no particular fan of sea-based action, so this ain&#x27;t no visual
effects spectacle, but it&#x27;s a satisfactory spectacle nonetheless, for
there&#x27;s a smile on my face when thinking of it, and thinking of its
complexities and various treats (and especially the opening scene which
is a landmark in film history) [&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;revisiting-pirates-of-the-caribbean-3&quot;&gt;update: 03 Mar 2008&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;].&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mentioned the complexities, possibly a deliberate attempt by movie
makers to have viewers give the movie a second look, for there&#x27;s so
much plot, so many betrayals, so many surprises, some disappointments
(an annoying marriage; Chow Yun-Fat&#x27;s appearance), amazing make-up and
costume work (nothing new in the trilogy though), proliferation of
colorful characters (too many, even for a movie so lengthy)...&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty decent entertainment after all, but then I already saw
&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;apocalypto-2006&quot;&gt;Apocalypto&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Fearless&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;300-the-visual-masterpiece-pulp-fiction-the-ex-masterpiece&quot;&gt;300&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; so far this year, which still stand
to be beaten, though none have visual effects matching this pirates
movie, and I doubt there will be this year [&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;transformers-2007&quot;&gt;update&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;], which will
result in this being a reluctant winner in that department.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I saw &lt;em&gt;Toy Story&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; for the second time today since several years ago and
it hasn&#x27;t really aged, except for the technology of course. I saw it
after &lt;em&gt;Monster&#x27;s, Inc.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; which I considered the best in 3D-animation for
a long time until now (story not so fresh; an irritating and formulaic
one-eyed character). So &lt;em&gt;Toy Story&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; remains victorious and got the honor
of being the first of its kind. It&#x27;s even more enjoyable due to
providing code-names for Debian releases. The evil character, Sid, is
interesting to watch but my favorite is Rex for his innocent and
ever-smiling character.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I saw this one with greater expectations than it managed to fulfill,
emerging to be worse than the first two in the series. I was hoping for
ground-breaking visual effects, only to end up preferring those of
&lt;em&gt;Spider-Man 2&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <title>Davey Jones vs. Kong</title>
                <pubDate>Wed, 11 Apr 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
                <link>http://tshepang.net/davey-jones-vs-kong/</link>
                <guid>http://tshepang.net/davey-jones-vs-kong/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;The star of &lt;em&gt;King Kong&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, which I saw in late 2005, was easily the
greatest of all CGI characters ever. But then I proceeded on watching
&lt;em&gt;Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man&#x27;s Chest&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; in early 2006, whose Davey
Jones was so unbelievably real that I couldn&#x27;t choose between the two.
I checked web yesterday to see what others thought and it was roughly
split between the 2, some also mentioning Gollum (&lt;em&gt;Lord of the Rings&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
trilogy) to be the winner. Davey Jones and Kong far exceed the overrated
Gollum, and the two happen to be a tie, even though the Kong lovers
defend him due to his greater interaction with the environment. If I was
however asked to choose a personal favorite, it would have to be Davey
Jones, whose piercing eyes and screen presence is unbeatable.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a related note, I was surprised to find that many viewers found Davey
so real that they thought it was (incredible) make-up work. The same
happened to me regarding the first installment of the trilogy, &lt;em&gt;The
Curse of the Black Pearl&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, and in my case it was the transformed,
skeletal pirates.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <title>&#x27;300&#x27;, the visual masterpiece; &#x27;Pulp Fiction&#x27;, the ex-masterpiece</title>
                <pubDate>Tue, 10 Apr 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
                <link>http://tshepang.net/300-the-visual-masterpiece-pulp-fiction-the-ex-masterpiece/</link>
                <guid>http://tshepang.net/300-the-visual-masterpiece-pulp-fiction-the-ex-masterpiece/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;300&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; has unbelievably superb visuals and very attractive characters,
most especially the lead. Ancient warfare has never been portrayed in
such an impressive manner. Another thing of note is I enjoyed myself so
much that I felt the movie, at ~100 minutes, was way too short.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I watched &lt;em&gt;Pulp Fiction&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; on Saturday and am sorry that it hasn&#x27;t aged
well (or it just looks less impressive) which helps remove it from my
all-time Top 3 movies. I found Rosanna Arquette&#x27;s a superior
performance to all others while Samuel L. Jackson&#x27;s happened to have
more dramatic impact; the rest of the cast is pretty competent and the
script (and especially the dialogue) remains interesting.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;movie-of-the-year&quot;&gt;movie of the year&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man&#x27;s Chest&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; for its visual splendour
and excitement. The runner-up in this category is &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;shaolin-soccer-2001&quot;&gt;Shaolin Soccer&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
which is made by the same guy who made 2005&#x27;s movie of the year, &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;kung-fu-hustle-2004&quot;&gt;Kung
Fu Hustle&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;best-movie&quot;&gt;best movie&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-butterfly-effect-2004&quot;&gt;The Butterfly Effect&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is the year&#x27;s best movie, followed by &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;birth-2004&quot;&gt;Birth&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.
There is stiff competition coming from the exciting and superb
&lt;em&gt;Confessions of A Dangerous Mind&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; as well as &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;lord-of-war-2005&quot;&gt;Lord of War&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Such a
listing convinces me that, although the year wasn&#x27;t as exciting, it
probably had more supreme movies compared to &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;2005-movie-review&quot;&gt;2005&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;spectacle-of-the-year&quot;&gt;spectacle of the year&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing beats &lt;em&gt;Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man&#x27;s Chest&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; in terms of
size, not to mention breath-taking effects.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;performance-of-the-year&quot;&gt;performance of the year&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crispin Glover shines in a bizarre performance in the surreal &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;dead-man-1995&quot;&gt;Dead
Man&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Another favorite of mine is the almost comic one of James Caan in
&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;dogville-2003&quot;&gt;Dogville&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, however the year&#x27;s favorite is easily Eamonn Walker&#x27;s
dictator in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;lord-of-war-2005&quot;&gt;Lord of War&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, a great highlight of an already brilliant
movie. I found the character portrayal of Tia Dalma, the witch in &lt;em&gt;Dead
Man&#x27;s Chest&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, the closest competitor to Eamonn Walker&#x27;s character.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;best-female-performance&quot;&gt;best female performance&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole Kidman&#x27;s perplexed widow in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;birth-2004&quot;&gt;Birth&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is her most intense and best
ever. The most touching of female performances however goes to Amy
Smart&#x27;s in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-butterfly-effect-2004&quot;&gt;The Butterfly Effect&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for the part in which she&#x27;s a wasted
waiter.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;best-male-performance&quot;&gt;best male performance&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jack Nicholson steals the screen away from the two leads of &lt;em&gt;Easy
Rider&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, while John Malkovich is notable for &lt;em&gt;Ripley&#x27;s Game&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. Another
impressive, but overly self-conscious performance, is that for the
daring show host found in &lt;em&gt;V for Vendetta&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;best-cast&quot;&gt;best cast&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Red Dragon&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; wins in this category due to luminous appearances from the
likes of Anthony Hopkins, Edward Norton, Emily Watson, etc.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;direction&quot;&gt;direction&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;George Clooney really outdoes himself (even considering this is a debut)
in the beautifully-crafted &lt;em&gt;Confessions of A Dangerous Mind&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. This is
not nearly the genius that is shown in Darren Aronofsky&#x27;s &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;pi-1997&quot;&gt;Pi&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and
only masters wind up making electrifying fables like &lt;em&gt;A History of
Violence&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;beautiful-imagery&quot;&gt;beautiful imagery&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The festival depicted in &lt;em&gt;Ghost in the Shell 2&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is breathtaking.
Runner-up is &lt;em&gt;Rize&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&#x27;s well-sculpted climactic scene, the one in which
the performers dance to the sun with oil-covered skin, is so illustrious
the characters seem god-like.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;irritating-disturbing&quot;&gt;irritating, disturbing&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Life Aquatic&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; takes the lead here.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;action-movie&quot;&gt;action movie&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me not being comfortable about the fact that there weren&#x27;t too many
competitors, &lt;em&gt;Assault on Precinct 13&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; still deserves attention for its
action (though it&#x27;s no &lt;em&gt;Die Hard&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;) and good direction, even though
it&#x27;s got nothing fresh.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;scariest&quot;&gt;scariest&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;birth-2004&quot;&gt;Birth&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; wins for its edge-of-the-seat, slow thrills, well-enhanced by
its performances, owed to Nicole and the boy.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;script&quot;&gt;script&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only a genius could be held responsible for &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-butterfly-effect-2004&quot;&gt;The Butterfly Effect&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&#x27;s
superb, complex, and rich storyline. &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;lord-of-war-2005&quot;&gt;Lord of War&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; deserves honorable
mention for its very fresh take on gun-running, which happened to be a
foreign idea to me.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;prison-depiction&quot;&gt;prison depiction&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This ain&#x27;t no standard category, but nothing in my history of film
viewing beats what&#x27;s shown in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-butterfly-effect-2004&quot;&gt;The Butterfly Effect&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;character-design&quot;&gt;character design&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gorgeous designs in &lt;em&gt;A Corpse Bride&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; are breathtaking, but this only
applies to living humans and not the ghosts, which are too gimmicky for
my liking.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;strangest-movie&quot;&gt;strangest movie&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This honor goes to the weird &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;dead-man-1995&quot;&gt;Dead Man&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; which has some very memorable
scenes; It also has the honor of being totally respected by
master-critic, Jonathan Rosenbaum.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;cinematography&quot;&gt;cinematography&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Man on Fire&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, with excellent, grainy touches and handheld camerawork,
is followed by &lt;em&gt;Constantine&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&#x27;s gorgeous shots, &lt;em&gt;Delicatessen&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&#x27;s
ultra-polished images and, to a lesser extent, &lt;em&gt;Tsotsi&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&#x27;s shots of
SA&#x27;s less pleasant living conditions.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;music&quot;&gt;music&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tsotsi&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&#x27;s energetic Kwaito beats are well-executed, enhancing the
movie.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;war-movie&quot;&gt;war movie&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tears of the Sun&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; shows the tough realities of African guerilla
warfare, distorted as it may be.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;production-design&quot;&gt;production design&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tough competition sees &lt;em&gt;Constantine&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Man on Fire&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Spiderman 2&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, and
&lt;em&gt;Tsotsi&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; battling without a clear winner.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;visual-effects&quot;&gt;visual effects&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pirates of the Caribbean&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is up there with &lt;em&gt;King Kong&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; among the
greatest ever visual spectacles. An honorable mention goes to &lt;em&gt;SpiderMan
2&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and another to the lower-budget entrant, &lt;em&gt;Constantine&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;sound&quot;&gt;sound&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ring&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; uses wonderful sound to achieve its scare effort and is
followed closely by &lt;em&gt;Man on Fire&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;editing&quot;&gt;editing&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing beats &lt;em&gt;The Ring&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; here especially with the well-done flashbacks.
Runner-up is &lt;em&gt;Man on Fire&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;voice-talent-and-voice-overs&quot;&gt;voice talent and voice-overs&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One could watch &lt;em&gt;Sin City&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; just for the tough guy, deep male voices
heard throughout.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;shit&quot;&gt;shit&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Wars III&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; has the worst editing, worst acting, worst sound, worst
direction, but got beaten by &lt;em&gt;Eurotrip&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; as worst movie.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <title>2005 movie review</title>
                <pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2006 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
                <link>http://tshepang.net/2005-movie-review/</link>
                <guid>http://tshepang.net/2005-movie-review/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;The highly entertaining &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;kung-fu-hustle-2004&quot;&gt;Kung Fu Hustle&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is &lt;strong&gt;movie of the year&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. The
&lt;strong&gt;runner-up&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;, the surreal &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-triplets-of-belleville-2003&quot;&gt;The Triplets of Belleville&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, portrays rich
human emotion (boredom and pain in this case), perhaps reaching levels
impossible with live action.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;best movie of the year&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; - &lt;em&gt;City of God&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Top-notch film-making skill deserving of a masterpiece; same goes for
camerawork and editing. All this makes for an exhilarating ride through
the unbelievably violent streets of Mexico City&#x27;s slums. It&#x27;s the kind
of movie which reminds me of a &lt;em&gt;Pulp Fiction&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; while remaining very
different, except for a seeming fact that both directors relish in the
violence.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;performance of the year&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Li&#x27;l Zé, the incredibly vicious villain in &lt;em&gt;City of God&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. The runner-up
is Morgan Freeman&#x27;s performance (his best so far) of a loser and
old-time boxer in &lt;em&gt;Million Dollar Baby&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; which ties with Kevin Spacey&#x27;s
political activist in a superior &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-life-of-david-gale-2003&quot;&gt;The Life of David Gale&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. A lesser, but
favorite, performance of mine is that of Laurence Fishburne in &lt;em&gt;Mystic
River&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, proving that he shouldn&#x27;t be in bad money vehicles like the two
sequels of &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;spectacle of the year&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; - &lt;em&gt;The Island&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great visuals and an intriguing story-line help make this the year&#x27;s
greatest spectacle. The runner-up happens to be &lt;em&gt;King Kong&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; for nobody
has captured them ritualistic humans so perfectly as Peter Jackson did
here nor did anyone ever commit such superb visual effects to screen.
That&#x27;s some explosive shit, and I only wish the plausibility of the
story was given some thought. An honorable mention under this category
is &lt;em&gt;The House of Flying Daggers&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; for, even if didn&#x27;t like the love
triangle non-sense, I haven&#x27;t seen film battles quite captured like
this before. Harks back to a greater &lt;em&gt;Hero&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; which shared the same
director, Zhang Yimou. Another honorable mention goes to &lt;em&gt;The
Incredibles&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; which happened to be the most impressive of all 3D animated
films so far, and also blessed with a wonderful and fresh script.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <title>the unbearable Hollywood romantic comedy formula</title>
                <pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
                <link>http://tshepang.net/the-unbearable-hollywood-romantic-comedy-formula/</link>
                <guid>http://tshepang.net/the-unbearable-hollywood-romantic-comedy-formula/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;I don&#x27;t mind formulas much, but I&#x27;m a little picky on which are
acceptable. The one I particularly hate is that adopted by too many
romantic comedies:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lover meets lover (okay so far)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lover does not tell lover something important (shit&#x27;s about to
happen)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lover finds out, and being more than a little sad, breaks up (I
really hate this part because it spoils the oft-cheerful mood; I
hate it also because it feels so fucking artificial and unrealistic,
and makes some character look all uptight, unreasonable and&#x2F;or
unforgiving)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lover forgives lover (now that&#x27;s real cheesy, and annoyingly
predictable)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I seriously don&#x27;t understand this formula thing. Maybe I&#x27;m too
stupid to realise it&#x27;s what audiences like, that if they go watch a
movie in this genre, and find it doesn&#x27;t follow the formula, they get
displeasure and the movie loses money. Fuck them if that&#x27;s the case! It
pisses me off most especially because I tend to really enjoy some these
movies, and now I have to withstand this shit, just so I can get to the
good parts. So sad. I must get a life. Or I must just stay away from
Hollywood romantic comedies, and risk missing out on true gems.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
