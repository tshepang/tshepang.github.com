I\'d be more upset that he hadn\'t taken the opportunity to tell me to

make a semi-decent \"pork\" broth.&lt;/p&gt;

Swaziland, and Lesotho. I recently visited Mozambique, and it feels far
more different compared. The most notable thing is that Portuguese
dominates far more than English. It was quite hard to find people we (me
and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tshepomathopa"&gt;a friend&lt;/a&gt;) could ask for help as we navigated its largest city,
Maputo. Other issues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are too many people seeking to take advantage of foreigners,
    like overpricing much of their shit, and gradually lowering them
    when faced with protest. I suppose this shitty practice is found
    everywhere, but it\'s particularly rife there. At the border post,
    for example, you\'d have 3-4 guys trying to score something by
    offering the service of guiding us through the border (fill this
    form, queue here for this, etc.), and would ask for something like
    R100 for that... ridiculous! Perhaps I should not complain given
    the great poverty the country suffers... only desperate people
    would behave like that I\'m guessing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The condition of Maputo, the city we stayed at, is horrific. It
    looks like a very run-down Durban, and quite large as well. We
    didn\'t explore it as much as I would have liked, but it\'s such
    pain, given the language barriers, as well as hardly having any
    street names or markings on buildings. We were in bad need for a
    guide. Most on the buildings are in a very dilapidated state. A very
    rough guess is over 80% of them, though you\'d find something
    gorgeous here and there. The roads are heavily congested and the
    drivers very inconsiderate... the worst I\'ve seen. It\'s amazing
    there wasn\'t a traffic accident we\'ve witnessed. Anyways, it was
    mostly not a pleasant city, and so many of the streets were damn
    dirty. It\'s fucked-up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The prices of stuff was ridiculous. One particularly egregious
    example is the price of eggs as we saw in a franchise that also
    operates in South Africa. A pack of 60 eggs went for M360 (about
    R120)! That\'s about twice the price in South Africa. Accommodation
    was expensive too; the place we got cost about M2200 and that was
    the cheaper one we could get, but was yet disappointing:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We were provided only a single pillow for each of us (separate
    beds in one room), and it didn\'t look pleasant for the
    attendant to get us another.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There was just one parking space. That I just don\'t understand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The bed I was on was uncomfortable. I was discouraged from
    complaining because it just felt like I was bothering the hosts,
    and I had already complained about the not-cold water provided
    in the room. I don\'t like feeling like a bother.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The hot water was rather luke-warm, though it wasn\'t too much
    of an issue given the high temperatures of the city. In
    addition, the pressure of the water was quite low.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I didn\'t like it when one the senior workers asked us not to
    drink alcohol (in case we were planning to) because he was
    Muslim, and that it was a Muslim-owned place. Such arrogance!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sort of thing really lessened the enjoyment of the trip there. I
felt unwelcome really, and it made me miss my far-more-pleasant South
Africa. I am sure there is far less crime there, but South Africa is not
particularly scary either (in general). It also has far better and much
cheaper places to sleep. We could very well have missed some great
lodging places in Mozambique, that Maputo is just a shit place to be,
and we should have avoided it, who knows. We didn\'t do much research on
it really, and decided to take a chance. It didn\'t work out, but I\'m
glad we tried. I would like to go some other time (I hear there\'s great
beaches), but with proper guides, perhaps via a cruise ship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, we just decided to cut our trip short, and went back to
South Africa.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="travel"></category></entry><entry><title>a visit to Lesotho</title><link href="http://tshepang.net/a-visit-to-lesotho" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-02-01T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2015-02-01T00:00:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Tshepang Lekhonkhobe</name></author><id>tag:tshepang.net,2015-02-01:/a-visit-to-lesotho</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Maseru is a lot better than I thought:&lt;/p&gt;

    it pretty, and there were hardly any potholes. Sure there were
    untarred roads as you move away from the center, but there were
    hardly any shacks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was especially impressed by the parliament building... so
    majestic, made better by them overlooking the city down below. I
    feel it\'s a bit of overkill though... imagine what it cost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Something I noticed is the overly smooth tile surfaces, which is a
    health hazard. I saw it in 3 separate places:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A rather large mall, which is the only one I we saw&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A fast food shop (where the food was very unimpressive; I\'ve
    never in my life been served a burger whose bread was so dry it
    was hard)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A supermarket&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quality of service was rather horrible, and worse than any place
I\'ve been to in South Africa. Worst of this was the place we stayed at:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the gate, there was some guy who looked very unexcited about his
    life. He was just sitting there, his face looking down, and he
    didn\'t even give us a look. I guessed he was the security because
    he had a two-way radio.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The reception room was very stuffy... I wonder if the two ladies
    noticed. I didn\'t check if the windows were open. It must have been
    a result of some serious cost-saving. At least our room had that
    modern convenience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While waiting to check if a room is available, the lady openly asked
    some other worker to check if the room is clean. I asked what
    happens if it isn\'t, and she said she\'d just send us away. Weird.
    Not even \"I\'d get it cleaned right away for you, sir\" or
    something like that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We went away to do a city tour and came back late, so it was quite
    dark. There was no lighting on the path the the room, so one had to
    tread carefully.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It\'s normal practice for the light switch to be near the door, but
    not in this case. And it was so dark that we had to ask for
    assistance, and the light switch was near the bed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They guy that helped us with the light switch seriously needed a
    bath. He didn\'t look friendly either. I felt like we were a bother.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What wasn\'t near the bed, though, was a power socket (to keep my
    laptop charged), so I went out to ask for an extension cord, only to
    find there isn\'t any spare... it was used for the washing machine.
    Yep.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was curious what was on TV, and found horrible reception... no
    digital channels. There was no remote control either. When I asked,
    it was simply missing. Also, the price sticker for the TV was still
    affixed on it... 4,999 (Lesotho currency is valued the same as
    South African rands).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maybe there wasn\'t much they could do about this, but there wasn\'t
    water in the morning so we could bath and get the fuck out. The
    receptionist said the issue was in the area.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now, this is maybe the best on: before we could leave, they didn\'t
    open the gate for us before first checking the room. My guess is
    they ensured we didn\'t steal anything. The receptionist did earlier
    claim they wanted to check if we didn\'t leave anything. Maybe
    that\'s true :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe that explains the price... the room cost M290 for the night, for
both of us. Ridiculous cheap. We thought the price was per person. I
wanna check out some other super-cheap places elsewhere to ensure this
is the kind of service one should expect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, we went on to drive towards Hlotse, a town to the West of
Maseru. The road was quite good, and the view wonderful (Lesotho is a
beautiful country). Still, I didn\'t see much evidence of ridiculous
poverty for the whole 100km drive. It was interesting to see that the
traffic cops didn\'t have cars around. Serious cost-saving there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One last thing, the Lesotho side of the border stamped our passports
when leaving, but didn\'t when we entered. Interesting.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="travel"></category></entry><entry><title>fighting for work</title><link href="http://tshepang.net/fighting-for-work" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-09-09T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2014-09-09T00:00:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Tshepang Lekhonkhobe</name></author><id>tag:tshepang.net,2014-09-09:/fighting-for-work</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Here\'s a story of two siblings, one a 10-year-old girl and the other a

6-year-old boy. They also happen to be my relatives (kids of my cousin),
and are very fond of me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 10-year-old was just about to cut my hair, but being impatient, I
asked the younger one to do it, just so there\'s progress by the time
the older finishes doing whatever she was doing. Little did I know
hell\'s about to break loose. As the older one asked the younger one to
hand over the machine, he refused, and an argument ensued. None of the
two were relenting, even with my repeated pleading:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;\"Please let your brother do the cutting, and you can do the
    finishing touches\"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;\"Please let your sister do the cutting, and you\'ll get a chance
    next time\"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;\"Please share the task\"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a weird moment, seeing people actually fight for what looks to me
like unrewarding work... a chore. There was even tears from the
brother, who was very hurt, even mentioning how unfair it is, citing
facts like how the sister always gets to cut my hair, and mentioning
other benefits she gets that he doesn\'t, specifically the fact that I
tend to ride far with her on my bike (I don\'t have a helmet small
enough for the boy). He even hurled abuse to the sister in anger, \"you
are fat\", which wasn\'t taken lightly. Being immature, they each would
have had the work not go on than allow the other to proceed. This went
on for several minutes, and as I proved ineffective in having any
progress, asked their older (15-year-old) sister to do the job, but she
also sees a chore, so she wasn\'t very interested. She did intervene
though, and was rather effective, even though she sided more with the
10-year-old, citing experience... \"what do you know about cutting
hair\". The 6-year-old eventually relented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps I\'m pushing it... have you ever seen kids this young cut hair?
But I was thinking Why The Fuck Not!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, this whole exercise was weird as fuck and so unbelievable.
It\'s an interesting display of sibling rivalry, and these two do have
constant conflicts. I just didn\'t think they\'d also fight over who
gets to do work. It was also the most impassioned and long-drawn I
remember seeing between them. Luckily it wasn\'t violent, even though
one tried to forcefully take the machine from the other.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>'links 2014-06-04'</title><link href="http://tshepang.net/links-2014-06-04" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-06-04T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2014-06-04T00:00:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Tshepang Lekhonkhobe</name></author><id>tag:tshepang.net,2014-06-04:/links-2014-06-04</id><summary type="html">&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This slightly reduces my fears of great social instability since it

could even be worse, given we are said to be among &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_income_equality"&gt;the most unequal
countries in terms of individual wealth&lt;/a&gt;. There is no predicting the

unchanged is worrying.&lt;/p&gt;

respected more than I did Madiba. That would explain the fact of my
weeping on the morning I heard of his death, which is something I never
did for any single individual. For some time now, I actually asked
myself which of his many deeds lead to such reverence, and I don\'t
really know. I do strongly suspect though that it\'s the key role he
played in ending government-sanctioned racism against non-Caucasians in
South Africa. Being a Black citizen of that country, this is something
that affected me personally, and something I will eternally be grateful
for. In addition to that, this man is also not just a hero (being a
freedom fighter), but also a saint (promoting reconciliation with the
oppressors). It\'s not only that, but also the fact that he is
constantly hailed as an icon of peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a number of times, I would ask myself if there was anyone alive who
garners greater respect, and the only person who came close is &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/14th_Dalai_Lama"&gt;the
current Dalai Lama&lt;/a&gt;, but I must admit I don\'t know much about him,
beyond his winning a Nobel Peace Prize. Another candidate is &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desmond_Tutu"&gt;Desmond
Tutu&lt;/a&gt;, who frequently speaks against injustice, and also happens to be a
winner of that most prestigious of awards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is one other candidate, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noam_chomsky"&gt;Noam Chomsky&lt;/a&gt;, whose intellect and
activism I deeply respect. Watching and listening to some of his
political work some time in 2012 led me to consider him the most
valuable person alive. His influence is likely smaller than that of the
above-mentioned candidates, but being the world\'s foremost Anarchist is
quite something, especially given that it\'s the most attractive of all
political theories I\'ve yet encountered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, with a disclaimer that I am largely ignorant of world events, Noam
Chomsky takes the place of Nelson Mandela as &lt;strong&gt;the living individual I
admire the most&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>'links 2013-10-12'</title><link href="http://tshepang.net/links-2013-10-12" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-10-12T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2013-10-12T00:00:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Tshepang Lekhonkhobe</name></author><id>tag:tshepang.net,2013-10-12:/links-2013-10-12</id><summary type="html">&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;I have since moved back to Pelican on &lt;strong&gt;2013-09-29&lt;/strong&gt;, with [Elegant
    theme]. Reason: slow liquidluck development ([the author is busy
    with other projects]), though he has more recently been doing [some
    large changes in a branch], which I assume is not ready. There is
    also &lt;a href="https://github.com/lepture/liquidluck/issues/created_by/tshepang?sort=updated&amp;amp;state=open"&gt;a backlog of doc improvements&lt;/a&gt; I submitted, which are not even
    acknowledged. Do not consider this a complaint... the author in
    fact gave me more than I gave him... a nice piece of software. In
    fact, I might go back at some point, and will keep maintaining [live
    demos of the various liquidluck themes]. Also, &lt;a href="http://movies.tshepang.net"&gt;my movie blog&lt;/a&gt; is
    also still built with liquidluck.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have a separate post on [what I love about static website
    generators].&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;why &lt;a href="http://pelican.readthedocs.org"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt; rocks&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It has categories (&lt;a href="https://github.com/getnikola/nikola/issues/163"&gt;unlike nikola&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Post metadata:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if Date is not specified, file mtime is used (unlike
    &lt;a href="http://blogofile.com"&gt;blogofile&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if Category is not specified, parent directory name is used
    (unlike blogofile)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;titles are allowed to have any character (unlike blogofile)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there is an option to provide clean urls... remove trailing
    &lt;code&gt;.html&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does not force one into having ugly date-based filesystem structure
    (unlike &lt;a href="http://tinkerer.me"&gt;Tinkerer&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;why Pelican rocks not&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The default theme simply didn\'t fit my tastes, and &lt;a href="http://tshepang.net/favorite-pelican-themes"&gt;the other themes
weren\'t so satisfactory&lt;/a&gt;. I spent way too long fiddling with them, and
just couldn\'t be happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;why liquidluck&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I have moved to &lt;a href="http://liquidluck.readthedocs.org"&gt;liquidluck&lt;/a&gt;, and am hoping I will not be \'forced\'
to move again. It\'s way too much work, and it took multiple messages
between me and &lt;a href="http://lepture.com"&gt;the developer&lt;/a&gt; of this sleek new static site generator
just to get it to behave the way I like it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to override stuff that\'s done by the software, by using &lt;a href="https://bitbucket.org/tshepang/blog/src/1602cdf8/custom.py"&gt;this
script&lt;/a&gt;, which helped give it the advantages that Pelican has over the
other generators I mentioned, while also solving the one problem Pelican
has.. lack of a good-enough theme. This was achieved with the help of
that very helpful and responsive developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;issues&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no visible way, at least for the default theme, to
    subscribe to RSS feeds of individual Categories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The text is a bit blurry/faint with the default theme, and none of
    &lt;a href="http://tshepang.net/looking-at-liquidluck-themes"&gt;the other ones&lt;/a&gt; are
    close to good-enough for my liking, all but the promising one named
    &lt;a href="https://github.com/bingdian/liquidluck-theme-responsive"&gt;responsive&lt;/a&gt;. It got 2 issues so far (see &lt;a href="http://demo-responsive.tshepang.net"&gt;live demo&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Date is displayed at the bottom of a post... why make user
    scroll that far before presenting such a key piece of info.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no link anywhere allowing to visit Home.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Background color for &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; text is too unusual, and results in an
    ugly look. It does not fit with the general general theme, so should
    be grey really, which would match with that of &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; text. I fixed
    it myself with the following patch:&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gh"&gt;diff --git a/liquidluck/_themes/default/static/style.css b/liquidluck/_themes/default/static/style.css&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;li&gt;And then I moved back &lt;strong&gt;2013-09-29&lt;/strong&gt; due to development inactivity
    of liquidluck.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://pelican.notmyidea.org/"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt; is a static blog generator; it converts marked-up text files
to html (Pelican supports &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown"&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText"&gt;reStructuredText&lt;/a&gt;). The
resulting site is complete with an index (Archives view), Tags,
Categories, and Pages (for non-bloggy stuff like a CV or About Me file).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for my blog, its tree structure looks like this (&lt;a href="https://bitbucket.org/tshepang/blog/src"&gt;repo&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;build/...
pages/about-me.rst
posts/{arts/, computing/, misc/}
CNAME
fabfile.py
new-post.py
README.rst
settings.py
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;build&lt;/code&gt; directory is where the output of the build process is
    stored.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;pages&lt;/code&gt; directory is for any content that isn\'t blog posts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;posts&lt;/code&gt; directory is where the large chunk of content lives, the
    blog posts themselves. Each of the four directories in there
    represent a Category, for example: if you place some file in
    &lt;code&gt;arts/&lt;/code&gt;, the post will be marked as falling under &lt;strong&gt;arts&lt;/strong&gt; Category.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I host my blog on GitHub, using a service the call GitHub Pages.
    &lt;code&gt;CNAME&lt;/code&gt; is a file required by that service in the case where I want
    to use a domain other than &lt;code&gt;tshepang.github.io&lt;/code&gt;. It\'s content is
    &lt;code&gt;tshepang.net&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://bitbucket.org/tshepang/blog/src/tip/fabfile.py"&gt;fabfile.py&lt;/a&gt; contains the build instructions, all for convenience so
    that I only need to run 2 commands, one for the build, and another
    for GitHub upload. However, I mostly just run one command that does
    both.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href="https://bitbucket.org/tshepang/blog/src/tip/settings.py"&gt;settings.py&lt;/a&gt; file contains Pelican configuration. It should be
    somewhat mostly self-explanatory, but for those things that aren\'t
    so obvious, do consult the documentation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://bitbucket.org/tshepang/blog/src/tip/README.rst"&gt;README.rst&lt;/a&gt; has some basic instructions, as well as repository
    license.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now as for the post itself, you need metadata to go with it. This is
stuff like title, date, and tags. It can be tedious to create all such
mundate stuff, especially the date. That\'s why I wrote &lt;a href="https://bitbucket.org/tshepang/blog/src/tip/new-post.py"&gt;a script&lt;/a&gt; that
generates that file and populates it with the given metadata:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ python new-post.py &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;my blogging setup&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; misc --tags blogging
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is the metadata, and also the beginning of the file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gh"&gt;my blogging setup&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gh"&gt;=================&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;:date:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;2012-04-12&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nc"&gt;:tags:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;blogging&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The script also opens the file in my favorite editor, so I can start
adding content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I\'m done with the changes, I ensure I\'m in the root directory of
my blog, commit (&lt;code&gt;hg commit --message 'new post'&lt;/code&gt;) and run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ fab
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;That\'s a &lt;a href="http://fabfile.org"&gt;fabric&lt;/a&gt; command that uses the instructions found in
&lt;code&gt;fabfile.py&lt;/code&gt;. It builds the site, and then pushes it to GitHub Pages. It
also pushes the sources to Bitbucket. Within a minute, the blog will be
updated.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="blogging"></category></entry><entry><title>favorite buildings</title><link href="http://tshepang.net/favorite-buildings" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-09-30T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2013-09-30T00:00:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Tshepang Lekhonkhobe</name></author><id>tag:tshepang.net,2013-09-30:/favorite-buildings</id><summary type="html">&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;I just don\'t like the general look.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I had a look at the others:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://oncrashreboot.com/pelican-elegant"&gt;Elegant&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This the least static-like of all themes I\'ve seen yet which makes it
the most innovative. The search feature, which sets it apart from its
competitors, got me excited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has some issues though (&lt;a href="http://tshepang.net/favorite-pelican-themes#comment-1064640476"&gt;to be fixed at some point&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ignores Twitter setting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RSS feeds are supported, but the icons aren\'t made visible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It\'s also not the prettiest of themes, but it will have to do, at least
for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes/tree/master/gum"&gt;gum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was impressed enough that I was strongly considering settling for this
one, despite the following issues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;no Tags on individual Posts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;no Categories on individual Posts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes/issues/152"&gt;it doesn\'t display bullets&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes/tree/master/monospace"&gt;monospace&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[&lt;strong&gt;win&lt;/strong&gt;] simple and elegant design&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[&lt;strong&gt;win&lt;/strong&gt;] displays pages as a list, all but the newest one in the
    view&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[&lt;strong&gt;win&lt;/strong&gt;] me loving the Archives view&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Categories are not shown in a prominent place (e.g. menu bar)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;no Tags on individual Posts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;no Categories on individual Posts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ignores Twitter setting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Post titles are capitalised (minor issue)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes/tree/master/Just-Read"&gt;Just Read&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[&lt;strong&gt;win&lt;/strong&gt;] elegant and simple design (&lt;strong&gt;my favorite of all&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[&lt;strong&gt;win&lt;/strong&gt;] displays pages as a list, all but the newest one in the
    view&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Categories are 2nd-class citizens: they aren\'t shown on the index
    page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bullets are done wrong: the bullet-ed text is not indented&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;on post view, there is no distinction between Tags and Categories&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;too much border space on code snippets (&lt;strong&gt;pre&lt;/strong&gt; tag?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;background for code snippets is not distinctive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;[tuxlite_tbs]&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[&lt;strong&gt;win&lt;/strong&gt;] clean and simple design: nice menu-bar and sidebars&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tags aren\'t shown along-aside posts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/wrl/pelican-mockingbird"&gt;Mockingbird&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[&lt;strong&gt;win&lt;/strong&gt;] very nice and clean design&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;date on Archives looks like shit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;background for code snippets is not distinctive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Categories only visible on individual Posts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ignores Twitter setting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;does not support Disqus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/byk/pelican-neat"&gt;neat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[&lt;strong&gt;win&lt;/strong&gt;] the look is different; it feels calm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Archives view is not ideal, though it\'s not in a prominent location&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Categories are not shown in a prominent place (e.g. on menu bar)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;when &lt;a href="https://github.com/byk/pelican-neat#configuration-options"&gt;custom fields&lt;/a&gt; are not specified, they are handled in a naive
    manner:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;![naive handling of unspecified custom fields]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/tbunnyman/pelican-chunk"&gt;Chunk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[&lt;strong&gt;win&lt;/strong&gt;] a trendy look&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;oversized text, especially blog title&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;background for code snippets is not distinctive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Archives look like shit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ignores Twitter setting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes/tree/master/bootstrap2"&gt;Bootstrap 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[&lt;strong&gt;win&lt;/strong&gt;] the Menu bar is unbeatable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the general look is too busy:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the Categories and Tags on the right must go&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;who wants snippets on posts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;showing Category and Tag on main views&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;separate tag cloud page missing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;line length too long&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;all intentional actions are grounded on believes and desires&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;believes are motivationally inert&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some months ago, a friend enticed me to the idea of doing something
else, giving me contacts for &lt;a href="http://eiq.co.za"&gt;some company&lt;/a&gt; building software and
electronics products for the mining industry. So I wasn\'t actually
looking for work, but I was glad of the opportunity since I was sort of
stagnating, and it really looked like this new company did some fun
stuff, and I got the vibe that I\'d really get challenged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It\'s been 3 months now, and my guess was right. I keep getting
surprised by the levels of smart I encounter regurlarly. These are the
sorts of people I simply can\'t match with my lesser brain, but am glad
to work with, since they teach me so much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The systems we build are embedded, so I spend most of my time working
with C and C++, and it tends to be a serious challenge, given that
there\'s a lot less hand-holding with those than with my favorite,
Python.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="luck"></category></entry><entry><title>Valve appears anarchistic</title><link href="http://tshepang.net/valve-appears-anarchistic" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-07-14T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2012-07-14T00:00:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Tshepang Lekhonkhobe</name></author><id>tag:tshepang.net,2012-07-14:/valve-appears-anarchistic</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;While reading &lt;a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3408"&gt;how this legendary game creator is run&lt;/a&gt; (or at least used

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I\'ve been meaning to move my blog(s) away from Posterous, due to its UI
problems and ridiculously-slow page loads. I finally did it with the
help of &lt;a href="http://calepin.co/"&gt;Calepin&lt;/a&gt;, which itself has a bunch of problems. These are
forgivable since it\'s a Beta product:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The presentation is way too simple/plain, and doesn\'t provide a way
    to customise it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I spent hours struggling with Dropbox login integration, where I
    often had to go to Chrome\'s Incognito mode, and at some point, had
    to delete my Dropbox account as well, just to get it to work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It seems crazy that each time I want to publish I have to visit the
    web page to hit Publish, when Calepin should simply monitor the
    Dropbox account.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The blog is unreachable whenever I publish. This isn\'t such a big
    deal of course, but c\'mon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When hitting Publish, it takes way too long (several seconds) before
    the page is rendered on the blog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;...and am sure there will be more as time goes (proven by the fact
    that this list kept growing as I typed this post)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

are too far gone. Machines break down; a team can\'t get moving fast

Intensive-care medicine has become the art of managing extreme

hospitality is what I feel most people on the planet have never
experienced. We (me and two friends, who were just as impressed) were
treated like royalty. We slept there just one night though, so we spent
nearly all our time there in one yard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have never seen a family quite like this. My own (maternal) family is
quite close, but definitely not as kindly as this one. And by the way,
there are no exceptions. The love they have, and express, for each other
is... damn I wish I could express self better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I met Bongo again, and the guy\'s character hasn\'t changed a bit...
maybe even more shy than last time, I can\'t tell. Lwazi and Siya
weren\'t there (boarding school).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One could say it was me (us?) paying homage to that wonderful family
(it\'s been over 3 years), but also an excuse to go enjoy the warmth of
their welcome, not to mention the gorgeous scenery of the surrounding
hills.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="travel"></category></entry><entry><title>getting rid of junk</title><link href="http://tshepang.net/getting-rid-of-junk" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-01-22T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2011-01-22T00:00:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Tshepang Lekhonkhobe</name></author><id>tag:tshepang.net,2011-01-22:/getting-rid-of-junk</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;PZ Myers of &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/"&gt;Pharyngula&lt;/a&gt; fame is the best atheist writer I\'ve read yet,

customer service. The standard procedure is to lend customers a bike for
a few hours to use during the day, which normally happens when one takes
the bike in for service. My &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_F650CS"&gt;F650CS&lt;/a&gt; was giving me some trouble which
actually perplexed them for more than those few hours... a few weeks
actually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why I says they rock:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wasn\'t charged for the extra (perhaps dozens) hours of labour.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was lent a bike (actually 3, since the troubleshooting went for so
    long that they needed to sell 2 of those bikes in the meanwhile).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not sure if I should call this negligence, but there seems to be
    some deep trust these guys have for their customers, because no one
    cared to check if I could ride the variety of bikes they lent me.
    That\'s gorgeous, especially considering that one of the bikes they
    lent me was the superhot &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_F800S"&gt;BMW F800S&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course there is also the element of them encouraging loyalty, but
this still goes beyond the normal \"customer is king\" routine.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Obama administration not too shabby</title><link href="http://tshepang.net/obama-administration-not-too-shabby" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-11-23T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2010-11-23T00:00:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Tshepang Lekhonkhobe</name></author><id>tag:tshepang.net,2010-11-23:/obama-administration-not-too-shabby</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Given that I have very little interest in American politics, I find

among the most important being an introduction to Anarchism, a radical
political theory that opposes all forms of official hierarchy
(capitalism, communism, religion, etc), arguing that such things tend to
result in oppression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How I got access to that is via a package known as &lt;a href="http://packages.debian.org/stable/anarchism"&gt;anarchism&lt;/a&gt;, a set of
documents formally known as &lt;a href="http://anarchism.pageabode.com/afaq/index.html"&gt;An Anarchist FAQ&lt;/a&gt;. It\'s a very
comprehensive coverage of the theory, and going through it brought both
enlightenment and frustration, for it explained so many things that I
took for granted, while pointing out the causes. The theory is basically
presented as the best possible society humans could ever have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for me, I\'m not sure if it\'s actually true, although I lean more
towards it than alternatives (and I haven\'t read anything extensive on
competing theories, but intuition/experience tells me that capitalism,
communism, and religion all suck tremendously). I need more study to be
more sure, especially because the objections to Anarchism are heavy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me it\'s a scarier concept to introduce yourself as an anarchist than
as an atheist or a homosexual, because the implications are greater. In
fact, they are so great, that the word &lt;em&gt;anarchy&lt;/em&gt; itself has been
associated with chaos. That\'s an expected knee-jerk reaction you\'ll
get when you punt things like \"I reject all forms of official
authority, including all governments!\". But it would be nice if people
who shudder at the concept to spend time with &lt;a href="http://anarchism.pageabode.com/afaq/index.html"&gt;that great document&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My attraction to the theory perhaps is due to my radically liberal
tendencies (e.g., I don\'t see anything wrong with fucking my biological
mother, provided it\'s consensual, and there\'s no pregnancy). I don\'t
know where these tendencies originate, considering that I was a
religious nut back in my early teens, scared of the concept of hell and
similar forms of bullshit.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>Argument from Beauty</title><link href="http://tshepang.net/argument-from-beauty" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-08-30T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2010-08-30T00:00:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Tshepang Lekhonkhobe</name></author><id>tag:tshepang.net,2010-08-30:/argument-from-beauty</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;So there\'s a bunch of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existence_of_God"&gt;arguments for the existence of God&lt;/a&gt;, and

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;diverse (and therefore strong) economy; she stated Botswana is
    over-reliant on diamonds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;diverse tourist attractions; Botswana\'s tourism is nearly

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conversation opened my eyes a little bit, that there\'s a lot to
appreciate about South Africa. As I talked to more Botswana residents,
and read one critical piece of journalistic writing, Botswana, despite
being far more peaceful and having superior living standards (minimal
crime, kindly people, minimal poverty, far-reaching welfare), has some
serious smelly bits: abortion and homosexuality are illegal. I was
shocked by these two, and most especially about the second one. What the
fuck!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="travel"></category></entry><entry><title>'debate: Mike Licona vs Richard Carrier'</title><link href="http://tshepang.net/debate-mike-licona-vs-richard-carrier" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-03-23T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2010-03-23T00:00:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Tshepang Lekhonkhobe</name></author><id>tag:tshepang.net,2010-03-23:/debate-mike-licona-vs-richard-carrier</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I recently listened to a 2.5 hour-long &lt;a href="http://namb.edgeboss.net/download/namb/audio_files/apologetics_debates/debate-licona_carrier.mp3"&gt;debate&lt;/a&gt; between two scholars,

review&lt;/a&gt;). I became far more impressed with Richard\'s performance than
Mike\'s:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mike was the only one who displayed some arrogance (a silly joke
    here and a chuckle there, unsuccessfully forcing his opponent to use
    the word delusion instead of hallucination, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Richard was more convincing (and the knowledge he displayed of this
    topic is mind-numbing).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He was more clear with his arguments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He was seemingly more prepared (his opponent probably thought he was
    going to be a walkover).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mike was a bit embarassing at times when mentioning The Passion of
    Christ, especially the time when he was praising Jesus (I cringed a
    bit there), and Richard, by the way, ignored references to that
    movie.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on these points, I vote for Richard as the winner, with the
disclaimer that the latter part of the debate was getting too technical
for me to follow thoroughly.&lt;/p&gt;

the major dream mentioned here died with it. So am keeping this here for
its historical value... it\'s also not bad writing.&lt;/p&gt;

the major dream mentioned here died with it. So am keeping this here for
its historical value... it\'s also not bad writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was having a discussion with a colleague over chat software, asking
her about her major dreams. After some deliberations, and after
revealing my own dream of helping a million people, I was touched when
she stated she wanted to open a clinic offering free services as well as
a place to help unemployed mothers. I immediately wished I was rich
enough to grant her the dream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One reason I asked this question is I\'m actually interested in what\'s
in other people\'s minds and am often looking for inspiration. Her dream
reminds of a fantasy I once had, like if I had a billion Rands (divide
by \~8 to get US\$), what I\'d do is build a hospital and fund it for
years on end. That\'s largely because SA public hospitals generally
stink, both literally and figuratively. And while on that topic, I was
recently discussing with a friend that there were other issues that
escalated the problem before we even talk of insufficient funding:
efficiency and corruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While still on the dreaming side of things, someone mentioned that a
dream that truly drives a person is normally ego-driven. Reminds me of a
great dream of becoming a DD (Debian Developer) which kinda died. An
acquaintance also has an ego-driven dream of owning a private medical
lab. He did however admitted that it was a negotiable dream, and that
qualifies it as a fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While still on medical things, there\'s yet another acquaintance whose
dream it is to build a clinic of some sort, but I actually forgot the
details. What\'s interesting however is that when I asked specific
questions like how big it is and some such, she couldn\'t answer,
stating not having visualised it that far. I have learnt the importance
of visualising a dream thoroughly because that solidifies it pretty
well, helping it get further away from the fantasy category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another friend also touched me when he mentioned one dream of setting up
a soup kitchen for homeless people. Noble stuff that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dreams are great because focusing on them help reduce the pain of
hardship. They can be as simple as \"the salary will help me pay that
debt, and maintain my lifestyle too\", and those are worthwhile dreams
too, at least enough to have millions of displeased workers wake up
every morning to get to work. I\'ve also met quite a number of people
whose main dream is retirement. It used to be my driving passion and
motivator in building my business, but I\'m now more driven by what
I\'ll do with the ample time I\'ll have at my disposal after that
moment, and even more than that, am driven my the million lives dream
(helping a million people), most especially the ways in which I\'ll make
that happen: starting worker co-operatives, free IT training, FLOSS
(Free/Libre an Open Source Software) development funding...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually noble dreams, the \"I want to help improve the world\" sort,
are my favorites and I always get excited when someone mentions such,
not those of \"I want to have this house and that car\". I probably am
dishonest with myself, but as much as I drool at the sight and thought
of a Bentley Continental GT, pumping the retail cost of that beauty into
feeding a 100 hungry kids for a month is more my thing. I do of course
have non-noble dreams: travelling Africa and the world for fun,
acquiring a decent entertainment system and a serious gaming PC (am I a
sucker for hardware-pushing high-end games!), visit international film
festivals (am I a sucker for movies!), and even produce some short
movies, preferably animated, preferably with FLOSS (I am a
politically-charged wannabe!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine, a sports sucker, wants to sponsor one kid to go
professional in that field. Having loved to have had such an opportunity
as a kid, he wants to ensure some deserving kid doesn\'t meet the same
fate (and end up in career s/he dislikes). I know at least two other
highly-gifted people who didn\'t further their sporting careers due to
lack of support (likely financial). That\'s painful actually and
shouldn\'t happen to anyone. Another friend of mine wants to open a
dancing facility to help get kids off the streets. I\'m not sure if
that\'s a negotiable dream or not (it didn\'t sound like a priority
item, neither did the sports sponsorship thing by the way) but we are to
find out in due time...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A brother of mine, a gifted and multi-talented (composer, producer,
arranger, mixer, vocalist, sound engineer, writer) musician, wants to
help groom and promote a number of small-time artists. That would really
help in an industry where talent isn\'t enough to propel one further.
Also, this is in an industry where too many lacking that talent are
propelled forward regardless.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>'there had better not be life out there!'</title><link href="http://tshepang.net/there-had-better-not-be-life-out-there" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-09-17T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2009-09-17T00:00:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Tshepang Lekhonkhobe</name></author><id>tag:tshepang.net,2009-09-17:/there-had-better-not-be-life-out-there</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I thoroughly enjoyed re-reading &lt;a href="http://www.nickbostrom.com/extraterrestrial.pdf"&gt;an essay&lt;/a&gt; on why we better hope we

all the books with their filthy hands, and the probability that they
find something they want to buy is linearly proportional to the amount

with those twin towers, which to me were the most interesting structures
in all of New York, such that I still don\'t understand why I hear that
many didn\'t like the structures, the reason for which I still have to
find out.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Anarchism and the GPL</title><link href="http://tshepang.net/anarchism-and-the-gpl" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-08-16T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2007-08-16T00:00:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Tshepang Lekhonkhobe</name></author><id>tag:tshepang.net,2007-08-16:/anarchism-and-the-gpl</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was reading some old Debian posts where there was an argument brewing

regarding the existence of anarchy within Debian. A notable point raised
was that the existence of the GPL, the leading FLOSS licence, would be
impossible because a licence\'s existence requires laws to exist. The
argument was that, since anarchy is against law (due to the idea that
law is designed to defend the elites and oppress the majority), then
there can\'t be free software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What\'s notable about the argument is that it\'s pretty dumb. Now since
anarchy ain\'t mainstream, it seems okay to use the current system to
enforce some form of anarchy by law (use what little you have). GPL
creator himself states that free software (subset of FLOSS) existed in
MIT without requiring licences and then states that it\'s companies
which refused open access to code, forcing GPL creator (Richard
Stallman) to start a project to develop a truly free Operating System.
In an anarchistic society, there certainly seems to be no motivation to
develop non-FLOSS, but in today\'s rogue society, there\'s plenty.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>one less angel</title><link href="http://tshepang.net/one-less-angel" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-08-07T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2007-08-07T00:00:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Tshepang Lekhonkhobe</name></author><id>tag:tshepang.net,2007-08-07:/one-less-angel</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;There are not that many people I know personally who are angels, and one

included in Debian which I spent some time reading. This wasn\'t a
first-time effort by the way, for the doc is very large. What prompted
the post is the very radical idea contained therein that parents should
encourage their teens to engage in sexual activity, defending such a
position by pointing to evidence that much social decay owes to sexual
taboos. It\'s really amazing what I read and I haven\'t been intrigued
so much by a philosophical theory in such a long time. Oh, and by the
way, anarchism is an extremely attractive theory, though I have very
many questions still. I\'ll keep studying to understand more.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>Nanotech and Open Source</title><link href="http://tshepang.net/nanotech-and-open-source" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-05-18T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2007-05-18T00:00:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Tshepang Lekhonkhobe</name></author><id>tag:tshepang.net,2007-05-18:/nanotech-and-open-source</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was fascinated to find that Christine Peterson of Nanotech fame
