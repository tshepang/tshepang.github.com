            <p><strong>update</strong>: I am not running a business anymore (I gave up trying), and
the major dream mentioned here died with it. So am keeping this here for
its historical value... it\'s also not bad writing.</p>
<hr>
<p>I was having a discussion with a colleague over chat software, asking
her about her major dreams. After some deliberations, and after
revealing my own dream of helping a million people, I was touched when
she stated she wanted to open a clinic offering free services as well as
a place to help unemployed mothers. I immediately wished I was rich
enough to grant her the dream.</p>
<p>One reason I asked this question is I\'m actually interested in what\'s
in other people\'s minds and am often looking for inspiration. Her dream
reminds of a fantasy I once had, like if I had a billion Rands (divide
by \~8 to get US\$), what I\'d do is build a hospital and fund it for
years on end. That\'s largely because SA public hospitals generally
stink, both literally and figuratively. And while on that topic, I was
recently discussing with a friend that there were other issues that
escalated the problem before we even talk of insufficient funding:
efficiency and corruption.</p>
<p>While still on the dreaming side of things, someone mentioned that a
dream that truly drives a person is normally ego-driven. Reminds me of a
great dream of becoming a DD (Debian Developer) which kinda died. An
acquaintance also has an ego-driven dream of owning a private medical
lab. He did however admitted that it was a negotiable dream, and that
qualifies it as a fantasy.</p>
<p>While still on medical things, there\'s yet another acquaintance whose
dream it is to build a clinic of some sort, but I actually forgot the
details. What\'s interesting however is that when I asked specific
questions like how big it is and some such, she couldn\'t answer,
stating not having visualised it that far. I have learnt the importance
of visualising a dream thoroughly because that solidifies it pretty
well, helping it get further away from the fantasy category.</p>
<p>Another friend also touched me when he mentioned one dream of setting up
a soup kitchen for homeless people. Noble stuff that.</p>
<p>Dreams are great because focusing on them help reduce the pain of
hardship. They can be as simple as \"the salary will help me pay that
debt, and maintain my lifestyle too\", and those are worthwhile dreams
too, at least enough to have millions of displeased workers wake up
every morning to get to work. I\'ve also met quite a number of people
whose main dream is retirement. It used to be my driving passion and
motivator in building my business, but I\'m now more driven by what
I\'ll do with the ample time I\'ll have at my disposal after that
moment, and even more than that, am driven my the million lives dream
(helping a million people), most especially the ways in which I\'ll make
that happen: starting worker co-operatives, free IT training, FLOSS
(Free/Libre an Open Source Software) development funding...</p>
<p>Actually noble dreams, the \"I want to help improve the world\" sort,
are my favorites and I always get excited when someone mentions such,
not those of \"I want to have this house and that car\". I probably am
dishonest with myself, but as much as I drool at the sight and thought
of a Bentley Continental GT, pumping the retail cost of that beauty into
feeding a 100 hungry kids for a month is more my thing. I do of course
have non-noble dreams: travelling Africa and the world for fun,
acquiring a decent entertainment system and a serious gaming PC (am I a
sucker for hardware-pushing high-end games!), visit international film
festivals (am I a sucker for movies!), and even produce some short
movies, preferably animated, preferably with FLOSS (I am a
politically-charged wannabe!).</p>
<p>A friend of mine, a sports sucker, wants to sponsor one kid to go
professional in that field. Having loved to have had such an opportunity
as a kid, he wants to ensure some deserving kid doesn\'t meet the same
fate (and end up in career s/he dislikes). I know at least two other
highly-gifted people who didn\'t further their sporting careers due to
lack of support (likely financial). That\'s painful actually and
shouldn\'t happen to anyone. Another friend of mine wants to open a
dancing facility to help get kids off the streets. I\'m not sure if
that\'s a negotiable dream or not (it didn\'t sound like a priority
item, neither did the sports sponsorship thing by the way) but we are to
find out in due time...</p>
<p>A brother of mine, a gifted and multi-talented (composer, producer,
arranger, mixer, vocalist, sound engineer, writer) musician, wants to
help groom and promote a number of small-time artists. That would really
help in an industry where talent isn\'t enough to propel one further.
Also, this is in an industry where too many lacking that talent are
propelled forward regardless.</p>
