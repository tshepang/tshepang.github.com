  <p><strong>update</strong>: The lack of reliability, worst of which was constant
unavailability of my blog, led me to move on. This time it's <a href="http://pelican.notmyidea.org">Pelican</a>,
hosted by <a href="http://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a>. <a href="http://tshepang.net/blogging-with-pelican">Here's the setup</a>.</p>
<p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p>
<p>I've been meaning to move my blog(s) away from Posterous, due to its UI
problems and ridiculously-slow page loads. I finally did it with the
help of <a href="http://calepin.co/">Calepin</a>, which itself has a bunch of problems. These are
forgivable since it's a Beta product:</p>
<ul>
<li>The presentation is way too simple/plain, and doesn't provide a way
to customise it.</li>
<li>I spent hours struggling with Dropbox login integration, where I
often had to go to Chrome's Incognito mode, and at some point, had
to delete my Dropbox account as well, just to get it to work.</li>
<li>It seems crazy that each time I want to publish I have to visit the
web page to hit Publish, when Calepin should simply monitor the
Dropbox account.</li>
<li>The blog is unreachable whenever I publish. This isn't such a big
deal of course, but c'mon.</li>
<li>When hitting Publish, it takes way too long (several seconds) before
the page is rendered on the blog.</li>
<li>...and am sure there will be more as time goes (proven by the fact
that this list kept growing as I typed this post)</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite all these problems, it will have to do for now, until I find
another host, and maybe this time I will have to spend some cash.</p>
<p>In the interest of balance, here's <a href="http://tshepang.net/what-me-loves-about-static-website-generation">what attracted me</a>.</p>
