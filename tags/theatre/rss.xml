                <title>from offense to delight</title>

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I was invited to a show named &lt;em&gt;Best Friends, Worst Enemies&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; which I
described as &amp;quot;so bad it&#x27;s offensive&amp;quot;. And I actually was offended,
which was made worse by an appreciative audience, and they even stood up
at the end of it, offering an ovation. I did not like it because I found
neither the story nor the characters interesting enough to deserve the
stage. I just don&#x27;t see how people would find any of what was shown
profound or special or new. I complained to 3 people who also watched
the show, and they could not understand what my issues were (how does
one explain to another that a piece of art is not interesting). I also
felt like walking out, and could not wait for the end.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basic story: 4 wayward friends (sex and drugs) find baby at door step,
and a letter they find proclaims one of them a father, leading them to
do paternity tests, and ending with a dumb twist. There is humor all
over the place, none of which is particularly good. There are also
contrived circumstances and... fuck, there is nothing there!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, as I complained about the show, someone passively invited me to
another show named &lt;em&gt;Day of Absence&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, which was such a pleasure. Concept
is great (and fresh)... &amp;quot;white face&amp;quot; black performers play roles of
white people in shitty-ass USA where blacks are treated like sub-humans,
in a society so dependent on them that chaos ensues when they
mysteriously disappear. There&#x27;s lots of good humor, there&#x27;s decent
dialog, a wonderful performance by the guy playing mayor, and superb use
of breaking the 4th wall, where the director would complain about
mistakes the cast made, asking for re-takes. Another involved lighting
problems, which, I later found out weren&#x27;t actually part of the show,
yet served it so well.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Show wasn&#x27;t perfect, and there was even a moment were I felt sleepy. I
also felt the accents could do with a bit of work where,for example, I
could not tell if they were mimicking black or white Americans. I
sometimes also struggled with hearing what the fuck they were saying,
though that could also be a property of those accents. I felt
inconsistencies in those accents as well, as if they actors didn&#x27;t get
enough practice.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite those (rather minor) complaints, the director deserves much
respect for what she created (what&#x27;s her name?).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <title>Ma-Brrr</title>

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Following are my experiences of a musical play currently seen at State
Theatre, Pretoria. It&#x27;s about the life and career of Brenda Fassie, a
South African vocalist who was arguably the most popular artist in the
history of the country.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;first-viewing&quot;&gt;First viewing&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first night was the best experience I&#x27;ve so far had in my stage
play experience. It was electrifying and the audience agreed with me,
with a few goose-bumps here and there. It&#x27;s amazing how
larger-than-life one person can be made. It brought me much appreciation
of South African art, that there&#x27;s such a rich culture to export.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what are some the elements that made me so excited, the first time
around:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lead performance: I gained new-found respect for Lesego Motsepe, who
is famous for her long career in Isidingo, a soapie generally
regarded as South Africa&#x27;s best; the director even mentioned that
someone stated that she wasn&#x27;t LIKE Brenda, but rather, she WAS
Brenda; the result of the voice training she went through was
amazing, because she really sounded like her character&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;music: the compositions were remixed, and the live band bringing it
alive rocked; I wish it would get recorded because some of it were
improvements on the originals&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dancers: though the dancing merely okay, their energy was tops,
especially the guys, and the quality of the choreography also helped&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;costume design: what the dancers had to wear was mostly impressive,
and often offered an accurate display of dressing styles through a
bit of South Africa&#x27;s past&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;backing vocalists: wonderful, notably the fat guy, who had a tiny
moment to act, which was hilarious&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;extra emotion: well, Bongani Fassie, Brenda&#x27;s son, pitched on stage
unscheduled, and even joined the lead performer to sing &amp;quot;Too Late
for Mama&amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;miscellaneous: a bunch of scenes and moments are too many to mention&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that this was opening night may have helped a lot, as well as
close to sold-out venue. Now, the shitty thing about stage is that such
moments can&#x27;t be replicated, and even though it may have been recorded,
it&#x27;s just not the same.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;second-viewing&quot;&gt;Second viewing&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The revisit was something else. The attendance was really bad this time
around (a Thursday after Friday&#x27;s opening night):&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lead performance: she was probably tired and&#x2F;or discouraged by the
small and unresponsive crowd; she mostly didn&#x27;t even try to sound
like Brenda&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;music: there&#x27;s wasn&#x27;t a degradation, so kudos!&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dancing: less energy, and that there were fallen beads on stage
probably didn&#x27;t help&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;costume design: same shit, so nothing to say here&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;backing vocalists: wonderful, but the fat guy was just reciting his
words this time&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;extra emotion: well, the Bongani Fassie thing can&#x27;t be replicated&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;miscellaneous: no surprises, nothing new worth mentioning&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;third-viewing&quot;&gt;Third viewing&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went to see this for the third time, this time on a Saturday, so the
audience was much bigger than last time, and the show was far better,
making me a little bit obsessed.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lead performance: she did better than last time, but maybe not as
good as the first night&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;music: I recall enjoying the previous moments better, maybe because
I got used to it&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dancing: the energy seemed as high as the first time around, and I
enjoyed it more (I really the super-cool guys at the jazz club)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;costume design: same shit, so nothing to say here&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;backing vocalists: the nice fat guy was replaced by a less
interesting one&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;extra emotion: I kept getting (unbearable) attention from one
dancer, since I was on the front row seats; I guess she wanted to
steal the show, and I didn&#x27;t allow her (she was unrelenting) so I
shifted my attention away&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;miscellaneous: the kids called up on stage were much more fun than
on previous occasions&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
