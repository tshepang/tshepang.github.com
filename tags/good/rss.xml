                <description>&lt;p&gt;Liam Neeson gets to be tough guy nearly as impressive as his character
in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;taken-2008&quot;&gt;Taken&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and in a movie nearly as intense. More impressive, however,
is the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Nate_Parker&quot;&gt;Nate Parker&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; performance, whose incredible transformation near
the end of the movie is exciting.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie has some of the best action sequences I&#x27;ve seen yet, as well
as impressive dialog and direction. The visuals are also wonderful
(check the descent of the plane as well as its landing).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do, however, wish:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The acts of the villain were given better justification&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More people should have died, given the rough landing&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Never have I seen the idea of aliens portrayed with such realism. The
attempts at communication is exhilarating, the kind that &lt;em&gt;Contact&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
(1997) gave when I first watched it. Sadly, like that earlier movie, the
movie focuses way too much on the lead... I would have preferred more
attention given to the event. The worst of it is an ability that&#x27;s
revealed towards the movie&#x27;s end. It really takes away from the joy the
movie was. Why do they have to fuck with wonderful movies! Anyways, I
loved the beautiful imagery of the alien writing system, but they could
have made it look less than spheres on fire... at first, I thought they
trying to say that they need a new home due to fucked home planet.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;It got some very nice visuals in moments where magic occurs. The dialog
also feels fresh, and I loved the character design of the evil sisters,
which is some of the best I&#x27;ve seen, complete with their animation.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;If you can get past the boring setting, you will find an unusual and
entertaining story of a lady that is too stupid to realise that she
can&#x27;t sing. It is also filled with decent performances, but the one
that makes the whole thing worthy of existence is that of &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Simon_Helberg&quot;&gt;Simon
Helberg&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, who is embarrassed by being the pianist for the singer. He&#x27;s
flawless!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <pubDate>Sun, 22 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/zatoichi/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;good:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The concept of a supreme fighter who also happens to be blind was a
big draw for me. That, and the quality direction, makes for
compelling viewing.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The lead performance is good, but I enjoyed it less that of Shintaro
Katsu when he took the same role in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;zatoichi-and-the-one-armed-swordsman&quot;&gt;Zatoichi and the One-Armed
Swordsman&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (1971).&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;bad:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The geisha story received too much attention... it was done well
and touching, but also mostly boring.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The crazy guy running around with a spear is too annoying.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The violence inflicted by the lead was too often excessive... he
killed too easily.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;The squabbling and delegation of decision-making seen in the movie was
most entertaining, and also unique in my movie-watching experience,
complete with high-tension and interesting debates. The most admirable
character is the guy who operates the insect-sized drone.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am, however, sad due to some of the shortcuts taken, all regarding the
country the movie is set in:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The movie is set in Kenya, but there&#x27;s way too many South African
actors, a fact that could perhaps be forgiven since filming took
place in that country&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am told that the unhygienic handling of bread doesn&#x27;t happen in
Kenya&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No terrorist organisation controls any part of Kenya&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Possibly the most violent movie I&#x27;ve yet seen, this is made in the
style of video game first person shooters. I enjoyed the wonderful
performances: the villain was especially menacing, and the guide, given
multiple characters, was given an excellent performance by &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Sharlto_Copley&quot;&gt;Sharlto
Copley&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, in what is his most satisfying work since &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;district-9-2009&quot;&gt;District 9&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. The
story is also fascinating and so is the technology.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/iron-man-2/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;When the movie does not take shortcuts with the story (the villain is
too skilled in science&#x2F;engineering and also too strong; the Don Cheadle
character was able to use the suit without training), or being
annoyingly-stupid (why the fuck did Pepper Potts drive with bodyguard to
deliver the suit), it gets the delightful direction and dialog of &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;iron-man&quot;&gt;its
predecessor&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. The rivalry between Stark and Hammer is lots of fun to watch.
The villain is also fun to watch, even though his motivations were given
lazy treatment. All three are given very good performances.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <title>Avengers: Age of Ultron</title>
                <pubDate>Sat, 07 May 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
                <link>http://tshepang.net/avengers-age-of-ultron/</link>
                <guid>http://tshepang.net/avengers-age-of-ultron/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;I was not so impressed when I saw this one first time:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am afraid that the producers of the franchise are losing the plot a
little. The movie is entertaining enough, but I kept feeling it&#x27;s too
much of a money-making machine. The plot is rather messy, and the
action overly-frantic. I much prefer &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-avengers-2012&quot;&gt;the original&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did, however, love something in it:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite moment is the battle between Hulk and the super-sized Iron
Man. It&#x27;s a showcase of visual effects mastery, and what makes it
extra special is the setting... South Africa.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still do love the scene, but I love the villain even more. The writers
did a great job to demonstrate the fact that this character is a
super-intelligence, making him quite unusual and unpredictable,
resulting in it being unlike any character I&#x27;ve ever seen. I love his
various appearances: birth, broken robot, first meeting with the twins,
the severed arm, and the self-killing (in which he occupies a more
shitty body).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <title>Captain America: Civil War</title>
                <pubDate>Sun, 01 May 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
                <link>http://tshepang.net/captain-america-civil-war/</link>
                <guid>http://tshepang.net/captain-america-civil-war/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;I really, really love the new character, Black Panther, as well as the
performance. The suit is amazing and so is the fighting style. He easily
is the most interesting character in the movie. I do wish that his
background was given more attention though (how did he learn to fight so
well, and how did he manage to own a suit that amazing).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Runner-up is Winter Soldier, who was also the most interesting character
of the previous movie in the series, &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;captain-america-the-winter-soldier-2014&quot;&gt;Captain America: Winter Soldier&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 3-person fight near the end was something special, though its
motivation was not very believable. It was rather dark for the movie,
and steers too far from what we&#x27;ve come to learn about the characters.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like so many big action movies, the movies suffers from over-complexity
of the plot and action sequences, making it harder to follow and
appreciate. It doesn&#x27;t help that it had a ridiculous number of
characters, including 2 surprise additions. Having colorful characters
can be exciting, but they simply were not needed for the story.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/spotlight/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Great direction and editing work serve well this highly-entertaining story
about sexual abuses of Catholic priests. The characters are interesting
and impressively bold (see the new editor) and are given superb dialog.
Their commitment to the stories they tell is also admirable. What is sad
is that they are superior to the (admittedly competent) performances
they are offered.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Amazing direction kept one absorbed throughout the movie, even given
the numerous slow&#x2F;quiet moments. The acting is also decent and the
story, though minimal, exciting. The opening scene, that of the 2
graphs, is very scary, offering a good intro.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <link>http://tshepang.net/her/</link>
                <guid>http://tshepang.net/her/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;The movie is beautifully-shot, well-edited, and has an exciting concept.
On first viewing, the experience of the first 30 minutes or so was so
magical that I was led to think this may turn out to be at least
excellent. Sadly that wasn&#x27;t the case: feels like the writer didn&#x27;t
know where to take the story, or even how to end it. The direction style
feels similar to &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;tree-of-life-2011&quot;&gt;Tree of Life&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, only a lot less experimental, and a lot
more entertaining. A revisit resulted in something that felt rather thin
and boring.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite performance is that of Olivia Wilde. I&#x27;ve only enjoyed her
once before, &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;in-time-2011&quot;&gt;In Time&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and I&#x27;ve seen her in a few other places as
well, most notably the good-to-excellent TV series, &lt;em&gt;House&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. In all
that, she has never been this good (see the heartbreak moment), and this
desirable. It&#x27;s also a brief performance, a fact that&#x27;s probably in
her favor, given she&#x27;s not the most excellent of actors.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Fascinating, with an eery feel that&#x27;s accentuated by the overly loud
and uncomfortable score, it also possesses wonderful direction and
dialog. Performances are also good, most impressive of which is the
lead, though &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.imdb.com&#x2F;name&#x2F;nm4420495&quot;&gt;Sonoya Mizuno&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, playing food&#x2F;sex servant, offered the most
pleasure to the eye, especially when dancing. She&#x27;s so perfect.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I never liked the Minions from the time they were introduced, so I
didn&#x27;t expect to enjoy this, so it was a pleasant surprise to find this
movie better than the two previous ones. I thought it would be a tired
attempt at milking the franchise, but it turned out a good execution of
the concept of characters who derive purpose from serving villains.
Speaking of those, the lead villain is such a pleasure to watch,
together with the husband. Both are works of great character design and
animation. Their home is also a work of great visual design... it looks
amazing. I wish it was explored more.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Hugh Jackman did a good job here, more impressive the anything else
he&#x27;s done before. It&#x27;s a pity that his character goes too far into
unconvincing territory where its obsession leads it to do something as
stupid as de-activating the helpful robots. But even more interesting is
the title character: it&#x27;s humorous, enchanting, and also well-animated
(invisible visual effects). None of the characters are given any depth.
Regardless, the movie is captivating, and has a great ending, fairy tale
as it is.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;My favorite moment is in the beginning of the movie, where the lead
character meets one disrespectful guy. What makes it more fun is what
is revealed soon after, that he&#x27;s not actually in control. The rest of the
movie is also enjoyable, and remains so even on a revisit. It&#x27;s made
all the more fascinating by being based on actual events.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Robert Downey Jr. is a lot of fun to watch, and Stephen Fry
plays the most interesting character in the movie. I also enjoyed &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Jared_Harris&quot;&gt;Jared
Harris&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, whose villain character offers superb rivalry with that of the
lead. It&#x27;s my most favorite of his performances (though I wish his
character didn&#x27;t sing). Also, I have never seen &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Kelly_Reilly&quot;&gt;Kelly Reilly&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; this
desirable. The visual effects are at times eye-popping (see the escape
from the military). It&#x27;s fun watching Sherlock do his impossible
deductions.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some tiny problems:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This may be a fantasy, but the action is too unrealistic.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jude Law is not so interesting, and felt a bit miscast.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The gypsy sister kept hanging around seemingly without much purpose
really, and the story involving her and her brother is not so
interesting.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed the movie a lot better than its predecessor, and it&#x27;s even
better on a revisit.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;My bad memory tells me that this is the first pro-socialist movie I&#x27;ve
yet seen. It&#x27;s also well-made, well-written, and got very good
performances, my favorite being the mother of the lead character. It
feels like an accurate description of what socialist strive would look
like.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;A highly-enjoyable fantasy about a bad-guy video game character who
yearns for some loving. His acting on this desire, however, messes
things up since he was designed to be villain. Along the way, he meets a
delightful character in a form of computer glitch, an outcast that he
reluctantly befriends.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole thing is typical Disney, but it&#x27;s all good formula. The
animation is good (check the racing cars and the high-resolution game)
and the story enchanting, and it&#x27;s all predictable of course.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;It has good direction and acting (I&#x27;ve never seen &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tom_Wilkinson&quot;&gt;Tom Wilkinson&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; this
good, and I enjoyed watching the ultra-cool &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Omar_Sy&quot;&gt;Omar Sy&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;). But, it&#x27;s yet
another example of a well-made movie that ends not so well. It&#x27;s too
smart and fresh for such improbable things to happen, worst of which was
having the detective drive into a bad guy just-in-time. Regardless, the
critics gave it more hate than it deserved.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;The most exciting moment is the encounter with the author of the a
favorite book of the leading character. It was quite intense, and rather
surprising, though not entirely unpredictable. Willem Dafoe gives the
character some justice, even though the characterization feels recycled,
some sort of a caricature.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides that, this is yet another movie that starts off well and fucks
up later on. The fuck-up this time around happens around halfway through
the movie, which is around the end of the Amsterdam trip. The rest of it
drags on, and just feel overlong. I even got tired of watching the
leading lady, Shailene Woodley, despite her excellent performance.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <title>How To Train Your Dragon 2 (2014)</title>
                <pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
                <link>http://tshepang.net/how-to-train-your-dragon-2-2014/</link>
                <guid>http://tshepang.net/how-to-train-your-dragon-2-2014/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;I loved the character design of the mother, and that includes both the
look and movements. She was even better when masked, possessing
awe-inspiring presence, a feeling enhanced by her great skill of the
dragons. &#x27;Her&#x27; dragons, which are newer designs from those from &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;how-to-train-your-dragon-2010&quot;&gt;the
earlier movie&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, also received great design, most impressive of which is
the Alpha. Exploring the home of these dragons was quite an experience,
which is weird, given the careless character design elsewhere (e.g. most
of the human characters). The epic feel is among the greatest I&#x27;ve
experienced of any movie.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie is full of quality humor. Among my favorites is the romantic
attraction expressed by the girl for the new guy. It&#x27;s recycled stuff,
but well executed. There was also good humor (and charms) from the
dragons; check how playful they are with each other.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish more time was spent with the mother, since she is easily the most
interesting character in the movie. Instead, she&#x27;s later reduced to a
secondary character, and not even instrumental in the victory her son
emerges from. Also, the writers mostly neglected the promise she made to
teach this son about the dragons. Instead the movie rushes too quickly
to the son (and his dragon) being pretty much the sole hero of the
movie. So shallow, so sad. Wasted opportunity.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Exciting ride, all until the too-implausible elimination of the villain.
Could have been better if the humans lost actually, instead of the lazy
resolution, where the two heroes receive way too much pounding. The
enemy was also too advanced (faster, bigger, and better weaponry) for
them to make through that final showdown. Everywhere else if fine,
because the two heroes get multiple opportunities against this
impressive enemy. I also wish the enemy was explored more. The
single-super-villain-controls-all-others thing is just too stupid and
recycled (think &lt;em&gt;Independence Day&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;). and not worthy of a quality
offering such as this gem. Not even Tom Cruise is a blemish, and the
visual effects are supreme, even though they were showcased mainly at
the beginning.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/the-purge-anarchy-2014/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Intensely brutal story about a United States where, on one night of the
year, murder is made legal. It&#x27;s a fresh idea, and is executed well,
though a bit over-the-top at times. It&#x27;s also not a plausible idea, or
rather, it deserved better justification.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The performances are of decent quality, best of which are the rich
characters near the end, who view killing others as entertainment. My
favorite, though brief, is the leader of those who deliver the victims
to these rich killers: scary, yet somewhat sympathetic.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/enough-said-2013/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;The lead gives an amazing and charming performance. James Gandolfino is
impressive too, and they are both very believable. The direction and
editing are wonderful, all so smooth and out of the way, focusing very
much on the characters. It&#x27;s all blessed with an amazing script, a
rather unusual story (fresh), quality humor, and one of the best
on-a-date moments in movie memory.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue with it is that the second half doesn&#x27;t feel as solid as the
first, and the whole thing doesn&#x27;t feel like it has good re-watch
value. It feels more like (a really good) TV series, something like
&lt;em&gt;Girls&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was an interesting discovery that the director responsible for this
one (Nicole Holofcener) also made two other movies I love: &lt;em&gt;Friends With
Money&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;please-give-2009&quot;&gt;Please Give&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. For that reason, they deserve a revisit, more
so than this one :)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

engaging enough to not leave me feeling too punished.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;A brilliant concept, clearly inspired by &lt;em&gt;The Game&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; thriller and &lt;em&gt;Saw&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
series of horror movies. I am a fan of Ron Perlman, so long as he&#x27;s not
given shit roles like in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;pacific-rim-2013&quot;&gt;Pacific Rim&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. He does great work here, him and
&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Rutina_Wesley&quot;&gt;Rutina Wesley&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. The &#x27;happy&#x27; ending thing is also stupid. The voice
acting of the evil guy on the phone is wonderful, and so is his script.
What a pleasure!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Story concepts this good seldom have great conclusions, and this one is
no exception. The twist is just not needed at all (it&#x27;s too much of a
stretch, both the father and brother thing). It would have also been
nice to have more of a reveal of the villains.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/captain-america-the-winter-soldier-2014/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Far superior to &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;captain-america-the-first-avenger-2011&quot;&gt;the disgusting original&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, this one is even better than
&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-avengers-2012&quot;&gt;The Avengers&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, even without Hulk and Iron Man. The action sequences are
intense, though excessive (think &lt;em&gt;The Transformers&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;), but not too
frantic. My favorite action sequence is the Fury chase. The abilities of
the Winter Soldier matched that of Captain America, making him fun to
watch. I would have done without the flying guy (Falcon), who happens to
be overly skillful, like he was some super-human, which he&#x27;s not. Same
applies to the Black Widow character. The story is okay but does not
rise above the feeling that it attempts nothing other than keep the
franchise going. There&#x27;s lots of shortcuts, and not much depth.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;My favorite character is the super-fast mutant, and my favorite scene is
one where it stops security guards from killing his accomplices. The
humor is good and his abilities impressive. The time travel part wasn&#x27;t
done bad and Wolverine is interesting. The Sentinels are fearsome and
the power of Magneto ridiculous, much like he had in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;x-men-3-the-last-stand-2006&quot;&gt;X-Men 3: The Last
Stand&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see this received better reviews than any of the movies in the
franchise, but I think the &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;x-men-2-2003&quot;&gt;X-Men 2&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; was better.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <pubDate>Sun, 06 Jul 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
                <link>http://tshepang.net/cloudy-with-a-chance-of-meatballs-2009/</link>
                <guid>http://tshepang.net/cloudy-with-a-chance-of-meatballs-2009/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;It starts off amazingly well, with the same level of movie magic offered
by gems like &lt;em&gt;The Incredibles&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;megamind-2010&quot;&gt;Megamind&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, but is funnier by far.
Sadly, halfway through, things start being not so okay. That&#x27;s when we
get the ever-uninteresting, slow-the-movie-down morality talk, which
includes the beloved hero getting a little too cocky. There&#x27;s also some
annoying moments where the town inhabitants treat this hero unfairly,
like the moment where they attempt to attack him when something goes
wrong with his food-making machine. It&#x27;s fine when they are shallow and
stupid, but it gets unbearable when the writers makes them so
&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;unforgiving-characters-are-annoying&quot;&gt;unappreciative&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. One other not-too-kool thing is when these writers
push the boundaries of fantasy way too far when the food surrounding the
machine gain awareness, attacking the heroes to trying to shut the
machine down. That was just needless; the movie was already more than
good enough. Also, the mayor was just too annoying, given some villainy
that&#x27;s left unexplained.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, back to the good stuff:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The character design is amazing and so is the animation.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I enjoyed the character of the police officer, and the love he
showed for his son was touching.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The lead character is recycled, but still exciting enough.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The concept is great, and exploited well enough, even though it runs
out of steam about halfway through.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The food design is great. It reminds me of &lt;em&gt;Ratatouille&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, and even
rivals it. The most amazing of them all is the ice cream.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The jelly castle was a setting for the most enchanting moment,
making me wish fantasy was real.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/kung-fu-hustle-2004/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the most entertaining I have seen yet, I couldn&#x27;t get enough of
it since I&#x27;ve done numerous repeats of my favorite scenes. It&#x27;s a
showcase of tremendous (albeit underutilized) talent, but there&#x27;s also
many scenes and characters which should have been excluded. Anyways,
much of what one sees in here is simply stuff of dreams. Example: we
have a man catching a speeding bullet with great ease, a very
unsuspecting man at that, and dressed in pyjamas and the cheapest of
sandals, and a man who soon meets his match... I don&#x27;t know if gets
more exciting than that.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, the movie is very uneven (there are both very badly-made and very
well-made parts), and looks like it suppers from a low budget. The good
parts:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The grand entrance of the world&#x27;s top killer, complete with the
bullet moment, the opening of the wall, and the conversation he
enjoys before starting a fight the couple. His is the most
interesting performance (and character) in the whole movie.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The moments involving the musical killers. The concept is brilliant
and very fresh, and the characters are very interesting, especially
the blind one.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I loved the performance of the guy playing the elastic master. He
was not the sort you&#x27;d take seriously (ever so drunk, and grinning
like he was abnormal), but that perception would quickly change when
he was forced to get violent.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Of the three warriors in the poor part of town, Pig Sty Alley, I
loved the food maker and the dressmaker. Of these, the dressmaker
was the most interesting, while also giving the best performance.
Looks out for the brief moment when they spar together before
parting. Beautiful. You will wish there was more of a backstory to
these characters.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Lots of humor, brutality (the suffering of the slaves is just too
intense), violence, and heroism. The movie has the rare quality of being
entertaining throughout, a feat more impressive given the movie&#x27;s
running length of over 150 minutes. Tarantino also decided to go a bit
lazy on us (as he did with the &lt;em&gt;Kill Bill&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; movies) by sprinkling fantasy
over his script, where for example we find the heroic Django
highly-skilled with a gun, without a lot of training. Another example is
the number of men the DiCaprio character has at his command, an excuse
to spill liters of blood, as well as showcase the Django excellence. If
only the lead was a better (or more interesting) actor than Jamie Foxx.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite (and best) scene is one where the great Tarantino appears. I
find it the best directed of all, even though there are more showy and
complex ones. My favorite performance there is the oldest of the white
guys, played by &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Michael_Parks&quot;&gt;Michael Parks&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. I also enjoyed watching the guys in the
cage, not to mention Tarantino himself (good actor this guy). As a
sidenote, it seems he was not comfortable sayig the word &lt;em&gt;nigga&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;,
resorting to &lt;em&gt;blackie&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Although directing&#x2F;editing style is not new, it still feels fresh. The
visual effects are also done well, but the aftermath of the damage done
by both the title characters and the military is done even better. One
thing that&#x27;s impressive about the whole production is that it&#x27;s very
expansive for a budget of less than $1 million. You would not even
notice. Sadly, there is a point where the lead characters are tiring,
such that I&#x27;d appreciate if at least one of them got killed at some
point. They are also too damn lucky.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I don&#x27;t know how many times I saw this one as a kid, but I loved it
a-lot. I even went as far as proclaiming it to have the best martial
arts choreography of all movies. After this revisit, however, I am not
so sure anymore. I don&#x27;t have a replacement in mind though. It remains
impressive of course, but feels dated. The shallowness of the story
doesn&#x27;t help either... some important issues (racism, prostitution,
xenophobia) are highlighted, but it doesn&#x27;t look like the writers were
good enough to exploit them. They were pretty much glossed over, and the
romance was very unconvincing.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <title>The Triplets of Belleville (2003)</title>
                <pubDate>Mon, 19 May 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
                <link>http://tshepang.net/the-triplets-of-belleville-2003/</link>
                <guid>http://tshepang.net/the-triplets-of-belleville-2003/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Here&#x27;s what I wrote some years ago:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Totally unlike anything I&#x27;ve seen before, an extraordinary animated
feature, with some superb music, magnificent characters, and amazing
stylistic choices, and supreme storytelling... It&#x27;s an awesome
experience, pity it runs for less than 80 minutes. It carries greater
emotional impact than most movies I&#x27;ve seen.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here&#x27;s what I wrote in 2010:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That still stands except the last sentence, since the revisit brought
no such impact. Let me add that the movie is a bizarre ride (no
dialog, unseemly super-tough heroes, etc.) and that the highlight of
the wonderful music is the one track at start of the end-credits. I
also remember enjoying the raunchy opening sequence much more than on
this revisit.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a third viewing, it feels more a curious experiment than a serious
movie, and it remains as unusual as ever. I love the mother (her resolve
is impressive), but the title characters are even more interesting. The
dog, dumb as it is, is lovable. There is not much going on in the movie,
and if fact, what is supposed to be a climax is just a string of
fantasy-like quirky moments. By the way, I should have said &lt;em&gt;practically
no dialog&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. There is a bit, but no more than two or three sentences.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/the-human-centipede-2-2011/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;I do not remember watching a more extreme movie, in terms of
(hard-to-watch) gore. The director also tried real hard to make the lead
character as repulsive as possible, a character lucky enough to get a
wonderful performance by &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.imdb.com&#x2F;name&#x2F;nm4030776&quot;&gt;Laurence R. Harvey&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (his first movie).
Interestingly, this character cannot be blamed for the harms he inflicts
on others, given he&#x27;s mentally disturbed, complete with a rather
unhappy toddler-hood. It&#x27;s a pity three of the other characters were
just lazily-developed, making them unconvincing:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mommy was a cheap copy of the one in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;precious-2009&quot;&gt;Precious&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. The story went too
far by having her try to kill her own child, though the reaction of
this child, the lead character, was super-kool... so damn oblivious
to what just occurred. Did I mention I love this character?&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The horny guy with a large beard should have been given more of a
story. He is interesting, but his actions were just left
unexplained... his sexual attraction to the lead character. It was
also real stupid placing him near the workplace of this lead
character.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The loud neighbor was too much of an ass-hole, going as far as
assaulting the lead character for practically no reason. That was
just stupid.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I though it was quite daring to include the pregnant woman among the
victims. Worse still, her giving birth like that. Wow! Talk of pushing
boundaries. Also, the movie may not be as fresh as its predecessor, but
it&#x27;s a lot better (direction, cinematography, acting).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Possessing a great story concept, this movie centers around an
experimental drug that increases mental performance to beyond genius
level. The movie is filled with great visuals and there&#x27;s a nice
performance by the guy playing the Russian money-lender. As for Robert
De Niro, I really wish a more interesting actor was given the role.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

have been copied (inspired) from elsewhere. The whole thing is rather
disturbing though (&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ben_Foster&quot;&gt;Ben Foster&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is an intense actor; the sound effects
were extremely loud; the sounds made by the creatures didn&#x27;t help
either). It&#x27;s edge-of-your-seat stuff, with horrid enemies all over.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Real nice camerawork and direction; very interesting performances. The
brutal acts of the criminal are sadly left unjustified&#x2F;unexplained.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still feel the same, surprisingly, but I neglected to mention my
favorites: the driver, the court snitch, the private investigator (the
ever-excellent William H. Macy), and the desirable female detective.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I find it daring to have Denzel Washington play a character this broken.
Not evil, just broken. I don&#x27;t know what was the point of drug addict
lover; maybe it was added in order to have the viewers sympathize with
this Washington character (he cared for her even though she was also
broken), but his saving of lives already put him in our favor. No, she
wasn&#x27;t needed, at all, but she was welcome.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High quality direction, performances, and dialog; an unusual and rather
unpredictable story; an unneeded, but colorful, character (John
Goodman); an exciting airplane incident; a very fitting ending.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;A well-made and unusual sci-fi about some humanoid super-beings that run
the world. They remain unexplained, and they attempt to get the Matt
Damon character (good job) to be American president. Part of achieving
that is getting him away from his favorite gal, and although they give
something of a flimsy excuse, it makes the plot interesting. That&#x27;s
despite that fact that the romance is overdone.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Of all the (multiple) conversations the lead character has, my most
favorite is the one with the lady with red hair. This lead, largely a
passive listener, engages a more than usual, while also introspecting
self the most. One other scene I enjoyed is that involving a group of
four friends, who do a lot of negative talk, which is so deliberate it
feels rehearsed. Most of the conversations are nonsensical, which can be
challenging to my patience. It&#x27;s an interesting, and strange movie.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Hugh Jackman gives his best performance I&#x27;ve seen, and none of the
others are lacking. The movie is also very well-made, and I could smell
the skill (and freshness) in the opening scenes, just before the girls
disappear. The rest of it remains interesting, despite the running
length of over 140 minutes. I would have preferred something shorter,
especially since the ending bits are not quite as impressive. The twist
was also a big let-down, with the (newly-revealed) villain unconvincing.
Also, some key plot points were left unexplained, or maybe I just missed
them. One example: why did the suspects keep quiet?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/wit-2001/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;This somewhat experimental work chronicles the suffering and thoughts of
an intellectual giant during an intense cancer treatment that lasts
several months. The performance of Emma Thompson is incredible, and the
best she ever gave. There is not a lot going on, but there isn&#x27;t a
boring moment. Beyond the lead character, others are
highly-well-development, most especially the lead, the young doctor, and
the nurse in charge... what an angel.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie is important in highlighting the cold treatment one could
experience in health care facilities. This happens most in the early
moments of the movie, and even feels exaggerated, especially given the
prestige of the clinic.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;A very well-made, rather convincing&#x2F;realistic (the fresh dialog
contributes well to that), well-acted movie (Laurence Fishburne is a joy
to watch, and so is Gwyneth Paltrow). One favorite scene is when husband
(Matt Damon) is told of passing away of wife while in hospital. The
reaction is quite sad, and perhaps represents the best such scene I&#x27;ve
ever seen.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie is quite gloomy, and makes me impatient when we are actually
going to finally manage to be fully immune to disease
(nanomedicine&#x2F;genetics). The subject matter makes it among the most
important movies ever made.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;A lot more enjoyable than &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;red-2010&quot;&gt;its predecessor&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, it has one amazing
performance by Anthony Hopkins in a rather fitting role. Luckily his
talent wasn&#x27;t wasted here as was the case in the two super-hero movies,
&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;thor-2011&quot;&gt;Thor&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;thor-the-dark-world-2013&quot;&gt;Thor: The Dark World&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. I also enjoyed watching the Asian guy
(he looks lethal), as well as the romantic antics of the female assassin
(Helen Mirren) and his Russian lover.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plot of the movie is complicated and some of the humor works (see
the Helen Mirren paying with her feet while unleashing her violence).
But the movie is too much of a fantasy, and is way too loud. Some of it
was good though, and my favorite was the first, in which the hero
escapes from some especially unfeeling government agent.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;A very rough twist&#x2F;revelation happens near the end, and that alone makes
the whole movie worthy. It&#x27;s also well-made, well-written, and got
decent acting, my favorite being the lady that plays the twin daughter.
It is also one of those rare movies that let a tear escape from my
eyes... the bus deception incident.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie took things a little far by having this mother be an assassin.
Also, her old age make-up could be better.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

following to say later that year:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A revisit of &lt;em&gt;Cloverfield&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; wasn&#x27;t as much a let-down as that of &lt;em&gt;I Am
Legend&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and am even tempted that it&#x27;s so far the year&#x27;s greatest
achievement in visual effects. I just want more of that fabulous
monster, and hopefully in a really good sequel. Perhaps an equally
good sequel would be another discovered tape, maybe with a bigger
budget. Here&#x27;s me salivating on what could be an extremely satisfying
franchise. I just so much wish no one will fuck up the idea.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the above are still accurate, except I didn&#x27;t enjoy the plot as
much this (third) time around. The setup was okay, all but the romance
part of it, which just felt tired. I also found it far-fetched to have
the guy brave the monsters to go rescue gal, and managing to drag around
two more people on his quest onto a heavily-compromised building, up
dozens of stairs, all to find a gal heavily injured, yet managing to run
around for several minutes on end... makes me sad :(&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I hardly ever enjoy Tom Hanks performances, but this one was very
watchable, though his best moments are only at the very end, after his
rescue. I also enjoyed watching the lead of the pirates, which is a
rather unusual casting choice. He is also the most interesting character
in the movie, a villain that provides comfort for his victim, and &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;caring-about-villains&quot;&gt;a
villain we get to care for&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One other special thing about the movie is the subject matter, which I
don&#x27;t remember ever seeing explored before in movies: modern-day ship
piracy. Another special thing is the attention to detail regarding the
cargo ship, which is also a rare sight. The direction is of decent
quality and so is the tension.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie could be shorter though, and the numerous attempts by the
title character to prevail are tiring. The movie also moves too quick
from Somalia to the seas... there is not enough exploration of the
background of our villains.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Possessing some of the best works of cinematography and production
design ever, the movie also boasts some of the most intense dialogues
I&#x27;ve seen yet, and an amazing performance from Philip Seymour Hoffman
as a Catholic priest. His enemy is one of the most relentless characters
in movie history, played by a miscast Meryl Streep. Her lack of fear for
confrontation and her quick-to-act attitude are admirable, but her
brutality is rather unreasonable.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;The direction is very unusual, the performances are of high quality
(Brad Pitt is amazing, and so is Penélope Cruz, not to mention the guy
that played Hitler in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;downfall-2004&quot;&gt;Downfall&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;), and the story gets more edgy as it
progresses. I need to see it again to understand it better... it&#x27;s
complex, and much of what&#x27;s going on is only implied.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/excision-2012/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;There is &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;skymovies.sky.com&#x2F;excision&#x2F;revie&quot;&gt;a good review&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; about this, a movie that starts with more
promise than it delivers. The imagery is provocative, but not really
shocking. The movie done and written quite well, complete with quality
performances, my favorite of which is that of the lead. She&#x27;s also damn
beautiful, though nearly as much as the gal across the street... wow!
The ending is a let-down... too unrealistic.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I liked this bit in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fearnet.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;review&#x2F;sundance-2012-excision-review&quot;&gt;another quality review&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, which will become relevant
one you are done watching:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...she&#x27;s quickly blossoming into quite the amateur surgeon.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;The lady playing wife gives an amazing performance, most visible in the
moments of mental torment and physical exhaustion. She&#x27;s also so damn
pretty, her and the rest of her family. Another good performance is the
almost comic one by the lead perpetrator, whose few moments of talking
with the audience (us) represent a rather daring directorial choice,
given the seriousness of the situation. It&#x27;s also a very welcome
choice. The direction is excellent: see how the aftermath of a great
loss is done, and see how touching the love between husband and wife is.
The pacing is slow at times without being boring for a moment.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Would be kinda nice to be caught in an eternal day. Imagine all the
stuff you can learn, and all the experiences you can have. All the risky
things you&#x27;d do, and all the impact you can have on people. That&#x27;s
what the lead character does, and he goes as far as committing suicde a
few times, only to wake up the next day, and the next day.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie is done well, but has not aged too well. Would be nice to see
a remake of one of the most interesting movie concepts ever.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

fearsome contract killer, in a movie with excellent cinematography and
production design, and excellent writing. Another notable performance is
that of &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ray_Liotta&quot;&gt;Ray Liotta&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, even though he plays one of his usual characters,

Aces&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. There is not one other performance that is lacking, and even
&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Chris_Evans_(actor)&quot;&gt;Chris Evans&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; helped by hiding his not-too-talented face behind a large

by &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;David_O&amp;#x27;Hara&quot;&gt;the guy playing the villain&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. The film is quite enjoyable (not a
boring moment) and the romance beautiful. I don&#x27;t remember a woman
fearing her own child as is the case with mother of gangster. Good
direction and acting there.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Lots of exciting street shots, a very interesting (and immensely
desirable) female lead, some quality performances (the villainous
detective most especially), and nice production design. The movie did
not also need the political sob story involving some child. The two
instances of rivalry were done well: that between the lead and the
co-worker, and between him and the police bicycle rider. The action is
over-the-top, and downplays the dangers these bicycle riders impose on
others, and on themselves. It could have been just as exciting had it
been more realistic I think.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

(the evil dark energy and the epic duels), a far more interesting
villain, and superior character design. Sadly, we are still stuck with
two very uninteresting characters: those played by Natalie Portman (the
stale love interest) and &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Kat_Dennings&quot;&gt;Kat Dennings&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (the unfunny comic relief).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;The are three performances that stand out:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forest Whitaker gives &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;best-of-career-performances&quot;&gt;the best one of his career&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; playing the title
character. His is also a very well-developed character.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;James McAvoy gives an excellent one as the advisor, though his
character is not very fresh... tis been done before.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kerry Washington is both a desirable and very capable actor, and
there isn&#x27;t a lack of those two qualities here.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie is very well-made, complete with quality production design and
an interesting story.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;An unusual and somewhat dull movie which has the lead tell a the story
of his alien origins, a story so ridiculous it has people think is just
made-up as part of his entertainment set as a musician. This character
is played by a guy with an interesting face, a Jet Li lookalike, making
him a pleasure to eye. The other alien that later befriends him is fun
to watch, and the female police officer is pretty as fuck.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;A lot better than &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;x-men-origins-wolverine-2009&quot;&gt;its predecessor&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, it is even more unusual in that it
doesn&#x27;t feel like part of the &lt;em&gt;X-Men&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; franchise, both in terms of story
and direction. It starts off quite well, with decent family drama where
you wonder WTF&#x27;s goin&#x27; on. It proceeds to some intense gritty action,
and some cheesy romance, and finally gets a not-so-exciting ending. It
left me wishing there were more mutants, for what we have here isn&#x27;t
very interesting (the poison lady is curious, but she isn&#x27;t very
interesting, and neither is her powers).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few of the performances are interesting, most especially the gal with
the deformed face, though she&#x27;s too much of a curiosity than an
essential character. The son of the dying man gets a commanding
performance, though the characterization is rather stale... done so
damn many times before. I am no fan of Hugh Jackman, but this one is his
best attempt at doing the title character so far. The design of the
giant samurai armor is amazing.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish the cinematography and production design felt less stagey, and
the sounds less retarded (e.g. metallic sounds emanate from swords
cutting through human flesh).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I kept waiting for an explanation of why the couple kept their kids
isolated from the world beyond the family. I was even more curious why
the father, a very unpleasant character, went to the trouble of
supplying the son with regular pussy. None of that is explained, sadly
(unless I missed it). This father character annoyed me most about the
violent lashing at this regular pussy at some point (I find such
arrogance unbearable). The earlier lashing was not as saddening since
the girl, the most rebellious of the three kids, happens to be an
asshole.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie is well-made, and got unusual dialog, and a weird story. The
acting is all good as well, and so is character development.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Decent humor and an interesting lead make this watchable. There is good
anticipation of whether or not the guy under study is a lunatic. The old
girlfriend is desirable (as is the lead), and the carefree boss gets
sweet at times, even if he is cardboard character. Weird small movie.
Loved the ending. Romance was done okay, even if it is too typical of
romantic comedies.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;A well-made and entertaining dark comedy with interesting performances.
The lead performance also brought pleasure to eye, though it was never
quite convincing. The character is admirable though: she maintained
courage despite the mental torture (threats, harsh accusations, and
deception), though I wish she should have said more... too often she
kept quite while questioned. The direction is powerful, and so is the
story.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;The visual design is amazing, and it made sense seeing that it was Zack
Snyder at the top, the same director who brought us the visual
masterpiece that is &lt;em&gt;300&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. The movie has a weird feel to it, being such
a dark (and dull) re-imagining of the world&#x27;s most recognizable comic
superhero. It has incredible visual effects, some of which represents
the most epic hand-to-hand combat sequences ever put on screen. The
Superman suit looks amazing!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The villain (Zod) performance is very fitting, and so is the lead
(Superman). I wish the reporter lady died at some point, or at least not
placed in situations so dangerous. Regardless, it&#x27;s also a good
performance. I wish they had cast different people in place of Kevin
Costner and Russell Crowe.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

cinematography, direction, and cast, especially John Malkovich, who
gives his best performance I&#x27;ve yet seen. The story itself is okay
enough, but I enjoyed it a lot more on the first viewing. I also enjoyed
Angelina Jolie&#x27;s performance as grieving mother on that first viewing
than on this revisit, even going as far as calling it her best yet.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;1st review:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fantasy that is extremely funny in places and very entertaining
everywhere else. I found the rich man&#x27;s wife irresistible. In the
movie&#x27;s funniest moment, the ultra-dumb protagonist didn&#x27;t find her
so attractive.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;everywhere else&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; isn&#x27;t exactly accurate, since I found the moments
before the lead leaves the house quite boring. Also, I didn&#x27;t find the
lady &lt;em&gt;that&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; delicious this time around. It remains a special movie, and
kinda edgy, since you keep getting worried if anyone would actually
discover that our hero is actually a retard.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;The two toughest guys, the brother and the Russian guy, are scary as
fuck. The military back-story felt a little tired, and if anything, just
made the movie longer. It was done quite well though, so am not
complaining (much).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The teacher guy gives a very nice performance, and so is the wife. Nick
Nolte (the father character) does the usual, boring, business-as-usual
performance.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conclusion feels far-fetched, with the predictable-ness that is all
too common in sports movies, but the entire thing is very well-made and
has real nice fight choreography.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Very well-made, with solid dialog. This dialog (and script) is also
unusual, an example being the opening scene which, though interesting,
felt like an attempt to be different. It did work for sure, since I
enjoyed it enough to think the movie was going to end up excellent.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story focuses on the greatest accomplishment of Abraham Lincoln, a
man who I have, for a long time, greatly admired. One thing that&#x27;s
strange is that this guy appears to be just one of the guys,
distinguishing himself only through his smarts when he speaks. It also
doesn&#x27;t help that there is no visible security surrounding him to
indicate he is indeed the most powerful person in a country of millions.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <pubDate>Sat, 07 Sep 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
                <link>http://tshepang.net/kung-fu-panda-2008/</link>
                <guid>http://tshepang.net/kung-fu-panda-2008/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;1st review:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#x27;s a tremendous amount of fun to be had in &lt;em&gt;Kung Fu Panda&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, a
superb crowd-pleaser with some of the greatest action I&#x27;ve seen of
any movie. The filmmakers&#x27; taste however varies from mine; I
wouldn&#x27;t have chosen animals, some of which are simply a result of
eccentricity, and which I suspect to have been deliberate.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a third viewing, I still find the action impressive, but would not go
as far as &lt;em&gt;among the greatest&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. The lead character tends to be annoying,
partly because he&#x27;s used to legitimize lying (which is way too common
in movies), and partly due to the slapstick humor. He also survives way
too much physical pounding, and without a scratch. The movie is also
shallow.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Exposing the shit life of being an illegal immigrant (and the associated
poverty, where people go as far as selling own body parts). I watched
this due to the appearance of Chiwetel Ejiofor, who plays the lead
character. The character development is pretty good (check the friend
that works at the morgue, or the guy infected by some sexually
transmitted disease).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;It is entertaining throughout its entire 140+ minute run-time, but it
feels like a desperate attempt to be trendy&#x2F;stylish. See for example
going for the gorgeous Salma Hayek as lead villain, or the three-some
thing. Brutality is fine in movies (scary shit keeps me on
edge-of-seat), but the rape scene was just not needed. Anyways, this
isn&#x27;t serious film-making.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I saw this first time some years ago, and it remains a quality movie.
Pity that it doesn&#x27;t quite reach the levels it attempted to. It&#x27;s
well-made of course, with some decent performances. I just don&#x27;t know
what the point of it all is. For example, it sounds like someone was
desperate to have us look at the good side of the racist police officer.
It felt a little desperate. Also, why have the robber get shot by the
good cop? Anyways, I did like the prelude to the first robbery scene.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/goodbye-uncle-tom-1971/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;The most brutal slavery movie I&#x27;ve seen yet, though peppered with humor
all over the place: it&#x27;s a dark comedy&#x2F;satire, which is a rather daring
approach considering the subject material. It&#x27;s interesting to note the
cruelty Black people here face, which isn&#x27;t better than that of farm
animals. Makes me feel guilty for eating meat, much like &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rogerebert.com&#x2F;reviews&#x2F;farewell-uncle-tom-1972&quot;&gt;Roger Ebert
makes me feel&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for calling this movie good.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish more effort should have been made to make the blood more
convincing. The weirdness of the final scenes, those shot in modern
days, isn&#x27;t welcome either. They are too eccentric and meaningless.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <pubDate>Sun, 07 Jul 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
                <link>http://tshepang.net/network-1976/</link>
                <guid>http://tshepang.net/network-1976/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Here&#x27;s what I wrote in 2009:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a strong satire like &lt;em&gt;Network&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, complete with powerful appearances
by Faye Dunaway and Robert Duvall, one tends to wish the entire thing
was shot and edited at least as well as it&#x27;s mightier counterpart,
&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;dr-strangelove-1964&quot;&gt;Dr. Strangelove&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. It&#x27;s got quite some heavy-handed dialog that may
have inspired the superior and much younger &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;good-night-and-good-luck-2005&quot;&gt;Good Night &amp;amp; Good Luck&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.
What&#x27;s also commendable is that the one voice of sane reason actually
is offered by a man who is likely more cruel than all others in the
story (bar those in the last meeting of course, a moment which would
be a spoiler if revealed).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A revisit, as usual, didn&#x27;t impress as much. I still appreciate the
humor and satire, but the fact that it made me feel asleep is not a good
thing. I didn&#x27;t even enjoy the two performances I so praised above. I
don&#x27;t even remember who I was referring to by &lt;em&gt;one voice of sane
reason&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, and the latter movie I mentioned is a lesser movie overall. One
thing I still celebrate though is that very last scene... the meeting.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;A very enjoyable story with some very interesting performances, most
notably that of &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tom_Towles&quot;&gt;Tom Towles&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, who plays a rather disgusting character,
Otis. AFAIR, this is the only one of his performances I ever enjoyed,
and he&#x27;s just perfect. &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Michael_Rooker&quot;&gt;Michael Rooker&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is also a joy to watch, and
despite his incredible cruelty, remains a guy we all care for, perhaps
due to his care for the (delightful) leading lady.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;There is no shortage of good performances (I enjoyed watching the sweet
&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Pell_James&quot;&gt;Pell James&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and the beautiful &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Laura_Harring&quot;&gt;Laura Harring&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, but none was nearly as
good as &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Paul_Dano&quot;&gt;Paul Dano&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;). That and a strange and unpredictable (and often
edgy) script, as well as the excellent direction (check for example the
long shot near the end) makes for a very good watch.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would have been nice if the villainous behavior of one of the
characters was explained, or the ending not leave me speculating.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Well-directed robbery scenes and well-written story, but nothing really

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/cleanskin-2012/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;This would have been excellent had it not dwelled so much on the
terrorist guy. I did find his appearance refreshing at first (a fresh
and beautiful face, and a solid performance), but he&#x27;s simply not lead
character material. This is unlike the Sean Bean character, who gives a
very fitting character and performance.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first several moments are entrancing, and compete favorably in terms
of execution (and grit) against far more expensive productions like
those in the &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bourne_(film_series)&quot;&gt;Bourne series&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one weak spot in the movie is the beheader character. He was
supposed to be menacing and heartless, but he looks more fit for a
lesser movie, and the moment involving the baby was simply needless.
Luckily there is no shortage of superb acting, most notably from the
lady in charge, &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Charlotte_Rampling&quot;&gt;Charlotte Rampling&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/the-thaw-2009/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;A very edgy take on existential risk, this time the villain being a
parasite, which is a fresh break from the usual global war or virus.
Watching it, I thought of &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;contagion-2011&quot;&gt;Contagion&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (virus), an overall superior
movie, which was on a far grander scale (and budget). But this one is
more unsettling given it&#x27;s various horror movie elements, except
handled with far greater skill than horror movies normally get.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All performances are of at least decent quality, my favorite being that
of Val Kilmer. He was always good, but he seems to get better with age
(see him in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;felon-2008&quot;&gt;Felon&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;). I also liked the Asian gal and the Black guy (an
unusual performance, and a fresh face).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;My brother trashed this one, so I watched anticipating the badness, but
it just didn&#x27;t come. Sure 50 Cent (playing Jonas) struggles to speak,
but I thought he is a formiddable figure enough to forgive the lack of
talent. The rest of the performances are pretty good, but I&#x27;m tired of
watching the no-longer-interesting Robert De Niro. The character
development is also of good quality, and was best expressed when Jonas&#x27;
friends were shown around on their first day at work. The movie did feel
rushed though, and I was actually hungry for more of the racist guy. The
direction is very edgy, keeping me tense for a large portion of the
movie. The storyline is also unusual, and the middle-aged lady totally
edible.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;If we ignore certain arbitrary and stupid happenings, this movie is
quite well-made and has some decent dialog. It also feels fresh,
especially in the first half. It&#x27;s also the scariest movie I&#x27;ve seen
in a few years (if memory serves well), even though some of the scares
use tired techniques like loud sounds and sudden appearances of scary
figures.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish the lead could have been chosen for her talent instead of her
cuteness level.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Well-made and interesting, but pointless. Maria Bello is as good as
usual while Virgo Mortensen gives a poor performance. The kid playing
their son is impressive, and so was the brutal duo, who ended up trying
to rob the wrong guy.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;The movie is well-made, and has an exciting twist. The eveil acts done
by two of the characters needed better explanation, most especially the
first one (it was too sudden). I enjoyed watching the detective... nice
performance there.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gorgeous gal is a lot more appealing when she&#x27;s a cashier, as was

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Scathing, well-made satire; excellent and exciting during its first
half, and a slow-down in the second, with the usual consequences thing,
not to mention the annoying Jared Leto character. If only the movie kept
the delicious pace, and if only it kept the length at 100 minutes or
so...&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is Eamonn Walker&#x27;s best role, even though his performance didn&#x27;t
excite me as much as it did first time around; It was my most favorite
from among &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;2006-movie-review&quot;&gt;the movies I saw first time in 2006&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <title>Dark City (1998)</title>

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Innovative story concept, excellent elements (direction, cinematography,
production design), ultra-desirable gal (Jennifer Connelly), impressive
make-up (The Strangers), and an interesting eccentric character played
by Kiefer Sutherland. The Strangers are given good performances, most
especially the one leading the search.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite all the goodness, the experience is marred by some shortcuts
taken by the writers, some continuity errors, an uninteresting lead, and
some bad visual effects, most evidently in the laughable final showdown.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <title>Six Shooter (2005)</title>
                <pubDate>Sun, 24 Feb 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/six-shooter-2005/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;This 27 minute short is worthy mainly due to the loud and fascinating
young guy sitting next to the lead character on a train trip. He happens
to be the most insensitive character I have seen anywhere (if my poor
memory serves me well), and is funny at times. The ending is strange
though, and I guess deliberately pointless.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was inspired to watch this due to the director, who later on made the
weird and wonderful &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;seven-psychopaths-2012&quot;&gt;Seven Psychopaths&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;My favorite utterance from the movie:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A hooker comes out of the bathroom in a beautiful red dress. She says,
&amp;quot;Would you like to make love? Or, should we have an intelligent
conversation instead? I&#x27;ve been reading a lot of Noam Chomsky lately;
I think he&#x27;s a marvel&amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a very well-made dark comedy with some wonderful performances. My
favorites are &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tom_Waits&quot;&gt;Tom Waits&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and the Vietnamese psychopath. The latter also
happens to be the lucky guy who gets to experience some moments with
that one special hooker. I also loved the old lady in hospital, who also
happens to be gorgeous. Sam Rockwell, Christopher Walken, and Woody
Harrelson are impressive, but this is business-as-usual for them, so
nothing novel there.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Politically, the movie is important in that it does, in a rather subtle
way, condemn homophobia. It also promotes interracial romantic
relationships, which I always find beautiful.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;in-bruges-2008&quot;&gt;The earlier movie&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, written and directed by the same person, is a
superior work of art in many ways, though not as funny.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <link>http://tshepang.net/dredd-2012/</link>
                <guid>http://tshepang.net/dredd-2012/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Not really a remake, nor even an alternative take, but more like &#x27;based
in the same universe&#x27;. Far smaller than &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;judge-dredd-1995&quot;&gt;the 1995 movie&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and a lot
less ambitious (and a lot better, which was not a feat at all). Much
lower budget, and visibly so, as well as poorer visual design. Could do
with a better director&#x2F;producer combo. But, the story is actually pretty
decent, and the suspense well-executed. The movie could do with a better
cast. The guy with the eyes does give a decent performance though, even
though he has too much of a Frodo character in LOTR (i.e. not fresh).
Also, the psychic lady is at least as pretty as she could act. The
villain, on the other hand, is not so convincing.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should be grateful that I didn&#x27;t get to see lead actor&#x27;s untalented
face, though I was exposed to the embarassing mimicry of the Sylvester
angry mouth.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/x-men-first-class-2011/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;A decent attempt at telling the origins of Magneto and Xavier, their
meeting feels forced. It is good entertainment, but none of it is
outstanding at all. The visual effects aren&#x27;t any groundbreaking as one
would hope from a spectacle such as this. The villain is not
interesting, and so are most characters, especially his followers, all
shallow as fuck.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I remember loving the first scene, in which some teleporting character
manages to infiltrate the White House. That, by the way, is my most
favorite of characters in the movie, followed by the gorgeous mutant
with the same powers as Wolverine. It is a pity she dies like that. I
also loved Mystique, whose abilities are ridiculously impressive. There
are so many characters, and the movie handles them really well, which
reminds me pretty much of &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-avengers-2012&quot;&gt;The Avengers&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Like that movie, you don&#x27;t
feel like any character is left under-explored.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One other thing is the movie is by far better than &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;x-men-2000&quot;&gt;the original&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and
in many ways. That is a strange fact, especially given it&#x27;s the same
director responsible. It is easily the best of the X-Men movies.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Nearly a year after the initial viewing, I am a bit puzzled why I was so
impressed so much by this movie. It remains good, yes, but I went too
far by praising its direction, acting and cast, or even drawing
parallels with &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;se7en-1995&quot;&gt;Se7en&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I got right though was the twist:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The twist is silly, and just doesn&#x27;t justify everything that happened
before. It sucks when movie makers don&#x27;t know how to end a perfectly
good story. On a positive note, that&#x27;s when the lead character (Casey
Affleck) chooses to do a very noble act, making him truly admirable,
especially considering what he sacrificed.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, I was afraid a revisit would disappoint, especially because
this was the remaining movie I labeled &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;tags&#x2F;excellent&quot;&gt;excellent&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; in the entire year of
2012... it was going to be the best movie of the year. Sadly, not one
movie from that year went beyong the &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;tags&#x2F;good&quot;&gt;very good&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (7&#x2F;10) rating.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Weird why this gets such great accolades from top critics. Sure it&#x27;s
not bad and it&#x27;s actually well-made, but I don&#x27;t see anything that is
truly exceptional. It does however tell a very universal story,
regardless of familiarity with Japanese culture.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is extreme kindness and modesty in a widowed girl, often to a
point of ridiculousness, but then again such angels actually exist. My
favorite performance is that of the more pro-active&#x2F;talkative daughter,
one who scolds her father a bit about his drinking.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the acting, where the characters face the camera, is just
awkward, forcing one to notice lack of ability, most especially from the
lady playing the mother.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie was a lot less bearable on first viewing, due mainly to being
overly slow-paced, as well as being eventless. I did appreciate it more
on this revisit, perhaps because I could easily look past the stylistic
choice, and instead enjoy the ride where we get treated to quality
character development and a rather simple story sprinkled with extremely
polite people.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Robert Rodriguez is a strange director. He is a good director, but he
tends to deliberately screw up his movies with some nonsensical events.
He did this previously with &lt;em&gt;From Dusk till Dawn&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, where he would create
a quality setup, and then mess it all with lots of ugly creatures. He
does the same here, with lots of disgustingness, in a form of people
infected with something that turns them into zombies. It&#x27;s sad mostly
because there is nice camerawork, lots of quality acting (check
especially Josh Brolin as medical doctor), and lots of quality humor
(check the child and mother moment, as well as the first meeting with an
infected patient). It&#x27;s like some sort of &#x27;fuck you&#x27; from the
director.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;The character design (from the title character to the colorful trio of
cyborgs) is quite good. The action fight choreography is among the most
brutal and intense I&#x27;ve yet seen, though it is often hard to figure
what is happening, a trick that is too common in action movies. The
movie also possesses a curious (and effective) mixture of two worlds
foreign to each other, hip-hop and oriental martial arts culture. It&#x27;s
nicely spiced with the Samuel L. Jackson character, which helps bring
some humanity to an otherwise dark storyline.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;A harrowing tale of a woman yearning for freedom in poor and rural
China. It is a very meditative work, more powerful than &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;recent-movies-2009-05-04&quot;&gt;Raise the Red
Lantern&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and full of raw emotion (check especialy the guy who plays the
father, the movie&#x27;s strongest actor) and simple in terms of
storytelling. It also showcases the side of China I never really saw so
vividly displayed, the musical side. The movie is touching to the point
of tears.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amidst all the pain is at least one hilarious moment which involves
bed-wetting.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;With hilarious moments all over the place, much of which is unique,
fresh, and daring. The lead character, played by the brilliant comedian,
Sacha Baron Cohen, reminds me very much of the Adam Sandler&#x27;s in the
wonderful &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;many-recent-movies-2009-02-27&quot;&gt;You Don&#x27;t Mess With the Zohan&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, only a lot better. The movie
also has very good production design.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is one trashy scene where the lead helps deliver a child, but the
punchline actually makes it worth it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

he is cheating with is an extremely annoying ass who nearly tells on
her, not because he is moral, but because he is jealous. The character
is unbearable, and so is the performance. Another annoying character is
the delinquent friend, whose sole purpose must have been just that...
to annoy me. Another unpleasant character, though the only one that
seems sensible, is the strange bar man, perhaps because I could not
figure him out. He just feels so arbitrary, as does that delinquent
friend. One performance I enjoyed most was that of &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Timothy_Spall&quot;&gt;Timothy Spall&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. It
was likely the first time I ever saw him (I saw this movie first time
several years ago), which is something that instantly earned him my
respect.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The writers did quite well in terms of character development here, but
not so well on the entertainment side, which is an even more important
attribute. Movies are, after all, primarily meant to entertain. In too
many places, the movie is hard to bear, and it would be quite strange if
anyone involved actually enjoyed the experience of making it. It is all
humorless and dull, and full of pain, and disturbed characters.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;The two facts, that the lead character is not Jason Bourne and that the
story occurs in parallel with the events in the Bourne trilogy, make for
very interesting narrative choices. I was not aware of this, so it was a
bit confusing until it was clear. Anyways, I am also very glad that the
new lead is quite capable, which is a relief since I was concerned,
considering I did not like him in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-avengers-2012&quot;&gt;The Avengers&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. He still is not a
match of Matt Damon though.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quality of the direction itself also matches that of the last two
movies in the trilogy, but the fight choreography is even better, among
the best I have seen in a non-martial arts movie. I did not like the
chase sequence so much, and the lead opponent could be better.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I was mesmerised by the imagery, and I don&#x27;t see why it would be
regarded any lesser than that of &lt;em&gt;300&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. It was interesting to discover
that the same director was responsible.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite of the fantasy scenes is the first battle scene, which has
three mean-looking &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;suckerpunch.wikia.com&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Samurai_Warriors&quot;&gt;Samurai Warriors&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. The envisioning was near-perfect,
and the visual and character design masterful, complete with excellent
visual effects and camerawork.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie in general is well-made, and has great production design. The
music is decent, though too loud, and so are the action scenes. I wish a
better action director was involved, since the lack of experience of the
girls shows. Perhaps there should have been more time spent in training
them. The director tries to make up for it with frantic visual tricks
(camerawork, editing, and visual effects).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;strong&gt;sidenote&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;] It&#x27;s interesting that what got me to watch this is
&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.time.com&#x2F;time&#x2F;specials&#x2F;packages&#x2F;article&#x2F;0,28804,2101344_2101366_2101545,00.html&quot;&gt;Time magazine&#x27;s Worst movies of 2011&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, of which this was number 2. It
just happens that I was attracted by the plot of alternate realities and
a pretty gal wearing a sword. I later on discovered that the movie was
generally poorly received, both commercially and critically. Weird.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I found &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;thor-2011&quot;&gt;Thor&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; very unsatisfactory, the 2 recent Hulk movies very
lacking, and &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;captain-america-the-first-avenger-2011&quot;&gt;Captain America&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; fairly bad. That&#x27;s why I was concerned
when I heard that my favorite comic book hero, Iron Man, would be paired
with them into one movie. I was also concerned by the fact that Jon
Favreau was not directing. Luckily the movie turned out a lot better
than I expected.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what makes it so good:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The movie is directed in a similar style to those 2 Iron Man movies,
including the clever humor and laid-back acting style.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The movie has some of the best visual effects I&#x27;ve seen yet, and
about as large-scale as any of the 3 &lt;em&gt;Transformers&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; movies, without
the overly-frantic action where you can&#x27;t figure WTF is going on.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I found the reaction of the city public refreshingly-realistic:
instead of watch and cheer the heroes, they run away from danger.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;A very solid story with superb, but disturbing, direction. The concept
is among the best I have seen. The acting is top class, notably the
three leads: Guy Pearce, Carrie-Anne Moss, and Joe Pantoliano (in a role
that seems written especially for him). The twist sucks a bit
unfortunately, especially given that the lead appears to be a reasonable
character.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <title>No Country for Old Men (2007)</title>
                <pubDate>Sat, 01 Dec 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/no-country-for-old-men-2007/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;With tremendous suspense, superb performances, great cinematography as
well as immersive production design, this is easily the Coen Brother&#x27;s
best ever. The movie&#x27;s best scene is when the Josh Brolin character
explores the scene of the murdered gangsters; the atmospherics are
crying of perfection, and so is the execution of it all. Another thing
of note is the Coen&#x27;s love for the American South characterisations
(remember the touching &lt;em&gt;Raising Arizona&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;), and this is among the best
such treatments (e.g. check the guy who helps jumpstart the villain&#x27;s
vehicle).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kelly McDonald is a favorite here and not forgetting Brolin. And though
Tommy Lee Jones does a decent performance, I could have been happier
with someone else (he&#x27;s not a great favorite), and his role didn&#x27;t
need a superstar he is. The unflinchingly evil villain is fearsome, made
worse by his calm demeanor.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;As was with his previous &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;breaking-the-waves-1996&quot;&gt;Breaking the Waves&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, Lars von Trier, the
director, also here lets his character go through much suffering, though
not portrayed in as painful a manner. This is helped by the enjoyable
musical moments, made all the better by the supreme voice and
compositions of Björk, who also plays that unlucky heroine.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relationship this protagonist of ours has with the prison guard is
quite touching. This is helped a lot by the portrayal of that guard, by
&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Siobhan_Fallon_Hogan&quot;&gt;Siobhan Fallon&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, who gives my most favorite performance of the movie.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <title>There Will Be Blood (2007)</title>
                <pubDate>Thu, 22 Nov 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
                <link>http://tshepang.net/there-will-be-blood-2007/</link>
                <guid>http://tshepang.net/there-will-be-blood-2007/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Here is how I felt on first viewing:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before Daniel-Day Lewis&#x27; oil driller in &lt;em&gt;There Will Be Blood&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, I
don&#x27;t remember any other character in movie history as ruthless as Al
Pacino&#x27;s in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;recent-movies-2007-11-05&quot;&gt;Scarface&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;; Lewis&#x27; however is tougher, darker, and even
better-developed, rendering Pacino&#x27;s seem a mere maniac. None of the
other performances has any noticeable flaw either and the movie starts
like a masterpiece (the first few moments of silence showcases
top-class direction, the characters are amazing, etc.) and, though it
never lowers to the level of common fare, doesn&#x27;t quite reach the
pinnacle. The end leaves one wishing there could be more to the story,
perhaps a bit of color to an otherwise painful movie (there&#x27;s not a
single ray of light, bar the barely-explored romance of the lead&#x27;s
son). Interestingly, the entire work isn&#x27;t as depressing as the story
suggests, but rather more of an adventure, as well as a unique and
powerful exploration of mining life, not to mention a graphical
depiction of the dangers it entails.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a revisit, I take back the claim that Lewis&#x27; character is actually
tougher than Pacino&#x27;s. The rest of the review is still accurate though.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to add that the cast is among the best I have seen yet in
movies. In addition to the magnificent Lewis:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Paul_Dano&quot;&gt;Paul Dano&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; gives an incredible performance, one that is so good me
wonders if he can ever equal it.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Dillon_Freasier&quot;&gt;Dillon Frasier&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; gives among the most impressive child performances
ever. It is all the more impressive that this was his first
performance.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie could have done well with a different ending though, for the
one it has is a bit over-the-top, even though not pointless. This is not
to say it is not well-made of course, for it is in fact among the
best-made of all in the movie.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/pi-1997/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Darren Aronofsky, the director, uses the same unsettling camerawork and
editing style he later used in (the superior) &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;requiem-for-a-dream-2000&quot;&gt;Requiem for A Dream&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
with the aid of superb dialog and acting, notably Sean Gullette in a
lead role and Mark Margolis who plays the friend, and gives my most
favorite of his performances.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some unexplained things (e.g. the bleeding man, the brain),
unless it is a way of showing the mental suffering the lead character is
experiencing (&lt;strong&gt;update&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackexchange.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;9540&#x2F;105&quot;&gt;an explanation was given&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;). The movie starts
a lot better than it ends, and although made by a stylistic
master-director, there was at least two sleep-inducing moments.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Some nice performances by the kids, especially the explosives lover, the
lead character, the pretty gal, and my favorite, the movie director. I
loved also that of the guy playing the gal&#x27;s father. The train crash is
the movie&#x27;s best visual effects moment, and among the best crashes ever
in my movie-watching history. Character design of the creature, the
spider-like villain, could be a lot better.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Frank Langella, a decent actor, is a little embarassing when portraying
the infamous Richard Nixon. He does a caricature, and is given way too
much screen time, almost to a point where he is hard to bear. He must
have been having fun doing the performance, which must have been easy as
hell... stuff of comedies. The rest of the movie is very well-made and
does not bore for a minute.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the sad things of watching a movie based on actual events is the
tendnecy to wonder how much of it is fiction. As for this movie,
Wikipedia has &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Frost&#x2F;Nixon_(film)#Dramatic_license_and_factual_inaccuracies&quot;&gt;a nice collection of such cases&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;For a movie made in the sixties, I found the camerawork impressive.
Another feat is that the movie is entertaining for its entire running
length of 3 hours. Sadly there is too much idiocy&#x2F;retardation is some of
the characters, including that by the great Toshiro Mifune. I did
however love the movie&#x27;s most important scene, where his character
reveals his actual ancestry.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite part of the movie is the search for the samurai. I found the
characterisations of these warriors impressive. My favorite of them is
the quite one, who also happens to be the most skilled of the &#x27;seven&#x27;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Not intense enough to do justice to the subject matter, perhaps due to
being a little too unrealistic. It is however very well-made, has
quality cinematography and production design, and is well-acted. Forest
Whitaker is a pleasure to watch, as usual, Jude Law is damn gorgeous,
and the lady that plays his wife even more so. The girlfriend is not
interesting, sadly.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the subject matter, it would have been nice if there was some
explaination of how such cruelty came to be socially acceptable.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Quality direction, production design, cinematography, and cast. A decent
story which luckily doesn&#x27;t end in the tired way romances tend to be. I
enjoyed this more the first time around, mainly due to the sexuality
surrounding the man-whore and the rich lawyer. I enjoyed the
open-mindedness that she expressed, though she later on became
attached&#x2F;possessive enough to find the jealousy unbearable.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;A fun ride that is unlike anything done before it. Calling it a
masterpiece would however be a lot more than it deserves. Sure it was
made by the best director ever, it has the supercool Justin Timberlake,
has a superb lead, and has quality acting, incredible camerawork, an
amazing script&#x2F;dialog, but that is just not enough. Perhaps it was just
not gripping enough, or the story appealing enough. It ends decently,
though not in any way one would expect.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I found this surprisingly laid-back, and more humorous than other Tim
Burton movies. The greatest pleasure offered is the villain, perhaps the
most interesting witch in movie history. Her cracked-skin nature is also
something fresh (me have not seen such before), her sexuality amazing,
her passive and quick-acting personality welcome (check for example how
she does not waste time to get to meet her old lover), and her beauty so
incredible that she can easily be forgiven for her great cruelty.
Another surprise is the sex scene, which I enjoyed a lot. Good humor
there.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;3 things I really like:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the narration&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the animated inserts, which are accompanied by that quality
narration&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the character design and development of the Vogons; my favorite is
the poet, and each second with him is a joy&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie, which is rather quirky and not too well-written (it feels
incomplete), toys around with some interesting ideas, and feels really
weird. It, at the end, feels pointless. The character of the president
of the universe, though entertaining at first, gets annoying later,
especially with the 2nd head thing. The gal, when in the shower, looks
incredible.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I seriously enjoyed this dark comedy first time I watched. This was due
to the highly enjoyable performances of Pierce Brosnan (the assassin)
and Greg Kinnear (the much nicer guy). The freshness of the story even
led me to place it among the best movies I watched that year. On second
viewing, it started off very well, but the Pierce character, though
still very good (my favorite of all his work), just gets tiring with his
repeated self-deprecating speeches (&amp;quot;I am a mess&amp;quot;). Also, at times,
the character lacks believability. I also found the ending not too
satisfactory, that this assassin character would pull off the last job
so easily.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Superb direction ensures that we are kept on edge of seat for much of
the running length of the movie, and even the slow parts add to the
suspense. The lead detective is quite impressive, and I also enjoyed the
portrayal of the father of protagonist, as well as the (damn gorgeous)
wife of protagonist.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie opens with wonderful dialog, and the rest of it more than
lives up to the high standards that scene sets.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Special mention should go to the guy at the airport checkpoint. The
performance is amazing, though shortlived.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/man-of-the-year-2006/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;I was surprised that &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Man_of_the_Year_(2006_film)#Reception&quot;&gt;critics disliked this one&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for I enjoyed it much.
I found much of the humor great, and I found the performance of Robin
Williams wonderful. The romance however was not done very well, mainly
because the character of &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Laura_Linney&quot;&gt;Laura Linney&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, herself a very excellent
actress (remember &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;kinsey-2004&quot;&gt;Kinsey&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;), is very annoying.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those critics mentioned dislike of mixing the whole thing with
conspiracy, and in hindsight, it was quite unwarranted. The movie would
have done fine without it, and it was just not done right, and Jeff
Goldblum performance didn&#x27;t help either.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Too often if happens that a movie starts promisingly well, and in this
case, with solid direction and exciting acting, but later on lulls you
into boredom, forcing you to keep checking how long is left before the
end. It remains good throughout of course, but the (extremely)
unconvincing performance of Ewan McGregor does not help at all. I kept
waiting for &#x27;his moment&#x27;, but it never comes. There&#x27;s also not a
proper explanation why the lead character, played by Jim Carrey, was so
in love with that Ewan one.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a more positive note, Jim Carrey gives an amazing performance. I also
enjoyed that of the ex-wife.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;The suspense, which runs the entire length of the movie, is a bit hard
to bear. The movie also feels incomplete, some stuff left unexplained:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;why is the robot sinister&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;why does the robot help near the end&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what&#x27;s up with the old man&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;...&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The creature design of the humanoid creatures is incredible. The ending
is solid, and the famous alien, which is in baby form, is flawless.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;It was interesting to see a movie so big with action so intense set in
South Africa. Other than that fresh setting, there is nothing new at all
about the story.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is at least one inaccuracy... the train service shown is used
almost exclusively by the poorer among city people in that country of
mine.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;This one looks a lot better than the previous two (visual effects,
cinematography, production design). It also got superbly-realised
characters in the form the ghost-like creatures, the &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Dementors&quot;&gt;Dementors&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. This,
and a few others, were interesting concepts, but given the movie (book)
is targeted for children, the exploration is not satisfactory enough,
and the humor silly, perhaps to help make things less scary. I also
found the more grown-up children more interesting, most especially the
clever girl, one of the 3 best friends.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of time travel is given quality treatment, though it remains
silly, as is usual with time travel stories.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the best in the series.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Great martial arts choreography, some of the best I have seen; two
gorgeous guys, one the arrogant rural martial arts expert, and another,
the Janasese military leader, who is among the prettiest guys I&#x27;ve seen
ever.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is nothing really new here, and the lead actor could be more
interesting. Sadly, each of these oriental martial arts actors have Jet
Li to match against, and that&#x27;s a high standard of appeal. I am still
giving this one high marks because I seriously enjoyed it, me being a
sucker for its brand of formula.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;The uniqueness of the opening scene (breasts), and it&#x27;s song, provides
a good hint that you are about to be treated to something special, and
the movie does not disappoint, all until the needless cheating moment.
It&#x27;s very well-made and well-acted, and the spa gal has never been this
interesting. The dialog is incredible.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

perhaps the only one I ever enjoyed. Sadly, he gives the only
interesting performance in the movie. Luckily, the movie makes up for
this with various hilarious moments, one favorite being the

                <description>&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s a strange one because it feels so pointless by the end of it,
unless it&#x27;s just another anti-prison movie, in which case it&#x27;s pretty
much effective... the brutality is incredible. It&#x27;s also the first
time I&#x27;ve ever seen Harrold Perrineau play villain, and he is not so
convincing. The movie itself is very well-made, and the acting decent.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Julianne Moore and Annette Bening give incredible performances in
superbly-directed movie where they play lesbian mothers whose lives are
to be challenged by a stranger... sperm donor of their kids, also
played well by Mark Ruffalo. The issue is that he&#x27;s made so kool that
he&#x27;s not believable, and the contention he presents feels forced. It&#x27;s
an excellent premise, and interesttingly one that I haven&#x27;t seen
explored before, but the makers just didn&#x27;t know where to take the
story. I also don&#x27;t know what the point of it all is and it leaves a
few questions open.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

desirability charts, while the music her character does sucks hard. The
movie feels fresh (it&#x27;s not your typical pro-family fare), but not the
&amp;quot;family about to break apart&amp;quot; moment near the end, which is just too
common. Worse is that it&#x27;s annoying and feels contrived (and a better
actor should have been in the place of the government lady). The
attitude the older girl shows is also just too common, but it&#x27;s a
decent performance.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;The female leads, the mother (Tilda Swinton) and the daughter, are given
amazing, flawless performances. That mother is also given superb
character development, and so is the son, whose unenchanted mood and the
painful events he sees around his family fit very well with the ugly
camerawork and shit weather. The captivating subject matter (the
seldom-covered one of incest) keeps the movie edgy, even though the
dialog and the pace are kept to a minimum. The direction style makes the
whole thing feel realistic, and the focus on the boy made it feel like
you really are in his shoes, while the complexity of his character (he
was neither hero nor villain) made the movie all the more better.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found it sad that the two female characters outside the family were
thrown away without explanation, though they too were given good
performances.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;The wife character, played by Sissy Spacek, is not only
superbly-developed, but also desirable as fuck. Not only that, but it&#x27;s
a wonderful performance. The father character is however given the
movie&#x27;s best character development, as well as its best performance.
One other great performance is that of the bubbly guy from the US
military.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The director offers an exhilarating and well-written investigative
thriller, much like his earlier &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;z-1969&quot;&gt;Z (1969)&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, a more intense work, though
lesser overall. The subject matter is grim and the imagery horrific. The
filmstock is of shitty quality sadly, perhaps a deliberate decision, to
help make viewers feel unease.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Weirdly humorous, especially given the serious subject matter of a
police-controlled plot to assassinate a politician who stirs things up.
It&#x27;s pretty unique, and very well-directed, and the relentlessness of
the guy in charge of investigating the whole thing admirable.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;In animation, I don&#x27;t remember seeing a face of a female character as
beautifully shot as the lead character here. We also get to have
multiple such moments (she really is gorgeous!), which makes me suspect
the director must have oogled over her. The one problem though is that
she doesn&#x27;t exactly look the part of a supremely skilled warrior. Her
great strength is also left unexplained.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 2 more characters that could have been better:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hitomi, the leader of the rescue mission that helped the lead; she
sucks because she was chosen merely for some Japanese idea of sex
appeal, the sort so common in erotic Japanese soft porn stuff;
that&#x27;s no problem, except her character doesn&#x27;t fit the role, and
in a more severe manner than the lead herself.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dr. Gilliam Knute, the genius creator of a species similar to
humans, is also designed purely for sex appeal (she is pretty too).
She really isn&#x27;t my idea of the character she&#x27;s forced into. Also,
the moments involving her aren&#x27;t done very well, a lame attempt to
give the movie emotional punch.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the visual design is quite nice, but is inconsistently so. The
fusion of 2D and 3D is a bit poor, but some of the movements of the
characters (e.g. some movements like walking, or fighting) are quite
impressive. As for the designs of the exo-skeleton, did they have to
look so bulky? Anyways, the catwoman-like robots are wonderful to look
at, complete with their metal-cutting whips. This is one case where sex
appeal worked well.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Comments on articles tend to be bad, and if you are lucky, just decent.
They are seldom outstanding though, as seen of &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theglobeandmail.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;arts&#x2F;movies&#x2F;the-bang-bang-club-fizzles-with-compromises&#x2F;article2011622&#x2F;comments&#x2F;&quot;&gt;these ones&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; which are
critical of the article they respond to. Basically what&#x27;s happening is
that the critic does offer a decent review, summarizing the story
nicely, but then resorts to unjustified criticism. That is sad,
especially because I found the movie quite good. Read them (the
comments), for they are better reviews than mine.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am still going to given mine of course, by mentioning two main things
I really appreciate about the movie:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The portrayal South Africa (my home) is quite authentic. There was
good research effort involved, to the point of even using the
now-obsolete cash. The behavior and the utterances of Black people
wasn&#x27;t screwed up either (as it so often happens when foreigners
set a movie here). The one complaint I have is that the white guys
aren&#x27;t convincing as South Africans, and there doesn&#x27;t seem to be
any real effort to mimic local accents. I even thought that the real
life Club members were foreigners.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was amazed by the performance of one local actor, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.co.za&#x2F;search?q=patrick+shai&quot;&gt;Patrick Shai&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.
I&#x27;ve never given kudos to the guy, though he never got a heck of a
lot of chances to strut his stuff (the local movie industry is
nearly non-existent), but he really shined here, and gives the
movie&#x27;s best performance. I also find his character to be the
movie&#x27;s most interesting because, regardless of him being among the
leaders of a small group of tribal killers, he also happens to have
a soft side... literally a savior of one heroic guy. Watching him
was a serious relief since I was concerned that these guys would be
some sort of faceless aggressors&#x2F;victims. Sure about all of them
were, but at least there was him, and one other guy saddened by the
death of wife and child.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an important movie, and it&#x27;s sad that it hasn&#x27;t achieved the
popularity it deserves. I&#x27;m still not going to claim it&#x27;s a
masterpiece because, other than that performance, I&#x27;m not sure I wanna
give it a repeat viewing. It&#x27;s not because it&#x27;s unpleasant. It just
feels that what kept me glued were moments that won&#x27;t be so thrilling
second time around. I don&#x27;t know, I&#x27;ll see.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;nit-picks&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That scene depicting &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;iconicphotos.wordpress.com&#x2F;2009&#x2F;08&#x2F;12&#x2F;vulture-stalking-a-child&#x2F;&quot;&gt;vulture and child in hungry Sudan&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; should not
have been attempted, or at least removed from the movie. It adds
nothing to the movie, and too iconic a moment of history to be given
such a lame attempt. For one, the child in the movie didn&#x27;t look as
bony.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was left hungry for further exploration of the political climate
of South Africa, beyond the unconvincing angry Black guy criticizing
the White guys from profiting from taking photos of those in pain.
In fact I think it&#x27;s this sort of thing that makes the
&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theglobeandmail.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;arts&#x2F;movies&#x2F;the-bang-bang-club-fizzles-with-compromises&#x2F;article2011622&#x2F;&quot;&gt;&#x27;unjustified&#x27; criticism&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; I mentioned above make some sense. Such
things tend to only dawn on me some time after the movie has ended.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I praised the costume and production design when the movie began, but
not later on. I either stopped caring, or the excellence wasn&#x27;t
sustained somehow, I just don&#x27;t know. I was also impressed by the 2
ladies who portrayed Queen Elizabeth I. The conspiracy story wasn&#x27;t so
riveting since I&#x27;ve heard it before (and I don&#x27;t care much since I
think Shakespeare is overrated, either that or I&#x27;m not smart&#x2F;cultured
enough to enjoy his work). The movie is however very well-made, and non
of it bores at all, even though it loses steam part-way through.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I didn&#x27;t expect much from this since it was trashed by critics, but
found it quite entertaining, and filled with interesting characters. My
favorite is the character played by &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ken_Jeong&quot;&gt;Ken Jeong&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, a fun-loving criminal
with feminine mannerisms. One other great thing about the movie is the
setting, which portrays Bang Kok is some gritty, seedy city, where crime
is rampant and the police under-resourced. It feels authentic, whether
or not it&#x27;s based on reality. It&#x27;s a showcase of good production
design.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having watched the previous (and lesser) movie also makes one appreciate
this one more, even though the formula is the same.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;A very grim portrayal of a witch hunt motivated by an epidemic in some
ancient European area. It&#x27;s well-made and well-acted, and the battles
are more convincing than the more expensive movies set in its time, and
violence more brutal. There&#x27;s not one light-hearted moment, no comic
sidekick, just a whole lot of shit life. Lucky me being born here and
now.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <title>The Iron Lady (2011)</title>
                <pubDate>Sat, 05 May 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/the-iron-lady-2011/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;A wonderful cast:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meryl Streep is good as usual in the lead role, though I wasn&#x27;t
entirely satisfied with her portrayal of modern-day (frail) Margaret
Thatcher.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The lady playing the young Margaret, Alexandra Roach, is amazing,
and her performance the movie&#x27;s most interesting. I&#x27;m even tempted
to call it the movie&#x27;s best, but am held back from that opinion
given that it&#x27;s pretty much carecatured.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The guy playing the modern day husband, Margaret&#x27;s hallucination of
a dead man, Jim Broadbent, offers nice and laid-back humor.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The direction is sophisticated and smooth, though there&#x27;s too much
focus on the modern-day Margaret, with so many flashbacks that it&#x27;s
just distracting. I also left the movie feeling like I still don&#x27;t know
enough about this 20th century giant. Perhaps the treatment was a little
too humorous, and too soft, especially considering the great importance
of the issues involved in Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s reign as prime minister.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;The impression from the first viewing:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disgusting scenery and painful story found in this one-of-a-kind
movie reminds me of &lt;em&gt;Delicatessen&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, only amplified, and treated with
far superior skill, and a more engaging storyline. The sort of emotion
this sort of movie instilled in me is quite rare, and has similar
intensity to what is found in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;apocalypto-2006&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apocalypto&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. The costume design is
perhaps even better than what can be seen in the (lesser) &lt;em&gt;Pirates of
the Caribbean&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; trilogy.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The impression from a revisit:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Perfume&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; remains magnificent but got a few warts (sleep-inducing,
disorganised and overlong storyline, smallish events which don&#x27;t
serve the story, a very uninteresting Alan Rickman and an unconvincing
daughter) which can&#x27;t effectively be hidden by its strengths (an
original story, superb costume design and direction, superb lead
performer, great cast).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we all know, each repeat viewing of a movie is a different
experience, and in the case of this movie, each revisit proves I&#x27;ve
overrated the movie the previous time. In this case, for example, I
didn&#x27;t find the costumes that great, the lead performance so super, the
direction so laudable, nor the cast so great. Sure it remains way better
than your average movie, but the novelty just wears off.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/shooter-2007/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Similar in style to the &lt;em&gt;Bourne&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; series, it also happens to be quite
entertaining, although three of the major characters are given bad
performances (the lead, the love interest, and the black guy in power).
The subject matter is of a fearsome concept of sniper work, except that,
as regards to the story, it&#x27;s not convincing how far the bad guys went
for the cash payoff.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Nicole Kidman is kick-ass and so is her acting +++ check the almost
unbearable intensity she portrays at some high-brow show (probably
opera) which she visits with her boyfriend. The script is damn amazing
too, and so is the camerawork, and this, a drama, is among the most
suspenseful movies I&#x27;ve ever seen.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A revisit rendered the movie a litle boring, but the performances and
great direction kept it interesting. The story also felt a lot more
silly. I can even understand why the movie was so heavily panned.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s hard to imagine the movie having as much impact had it been told
in a more conventional way (there entire thing is done on a small stage,
which doesn&#x27;t change throughout it&#x27;s entire 3-hour run, except at the
very end). It&#x27;s an effective experiment that proves that, with good
directorial skill, a movie experience can be satisfying with almost no
budget. I however expect that only serious movie buffs would watch the
entire thing.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first viewing of this was among the most impactful I&#x27;ve had of any
movie, to a point where I called a masterpiece. A revisit wasn&#x27;t so
kind though because of diminished impact. I still love the narrator&#x27;s
style of storytelling (told like a children&#x27;s fable). I found the
character of the philosopher quite annoying (and I&#x27;m sure that was the
intention), a character developed and performed similar to that of the
scientist in Battlestar Galactica tv series (the one made in the
2000&#x27;s). There is not one other character that is interesting, that is
if we ignore James Caan. The movie is also frustratingly long and I&#x27;m
curious why it was made (why portray such brutality), and even more
curious, why was the annoying philosopher character added.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s interesting to have a movie that is both spooky and enchanting.
There&#x27;s a bunch of strange characters, and everyone of them are
designed badly (what&#x27;s up with these Japanese animators?), but the
story keeps it all interesting. This is despite the clumsy 2D animation
and shallow character development. The lead character is admirable for
her kindheartedness, and it&#x27;s touching seeing characters surrounding
her with affection, one of which is a spoilt baby and another, a greedy
and lonely monster that swallows sentient beings (a human, a frog, and
some other creature I can&#x27;t identify).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;There&#x27;s a number of enchanting moments, and Alice is sweet to the eye;
she is also lovely in battle costume and battle movement; the hatter is
at times fun (my favorite moment, also the saddest, is when exclaiming
how good it would be that he dies looking good); the evil queen is the
most interesting of all, despite the fact that her deeds are at times
too evil to swallow (e.g. her usage of an animal as a golf ball, or her
castle being surrounded by heads she severed). The movie however feels
rushed and the characters underdeveloped.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Among the best movies I&#x27;ve ever seen Jet Li star in, this is an
unforgiving portrayal of the brutality of war, and the horrid politics
surrounding it. I was amazed by some of the action, the highlight being
the cannon-hit-cannon moment, something I have never seen in any movie.
The movie itself was quite a surprise hit for me, for I never even heard
of it before, so I expected some passive actioner.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A revisit wasn&#x27;t as impressive, and in fact I found myself rather
impatient when it would end, and there isn&#x27;t great pleasure in the
sadness, and maybe also because I tend to look for an ideally good
character, instead of the lead character that Jet Li portrays, perhaps
the most complex he has done yet, more complete he has ever done
(sometimes he&#x27;s kind and sometimes not).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One bad casting choice was &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Takeshi_Kaneshiro&quot;&gt;Takeshi Kaneshiro&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, who plays one of the
three leaders and a narrator. He&#x27;s just not convincing in the role, or
maybe he&#x27;s just not a good enough actor.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Very enjoyable and well-made, but it feels a little thin in terms of
production design, and the camerawork does not fit a thriller so
gripping (this was fixed in the 2 sequels). There&#x27;s a bad performance
by the guy playing the African target, Clive Owen (playing one of the
assassins) was miscast and doesn&#x27;t do a good job. Matt Damon (Jason
Bourne) pulls the character quite well, and that&#x27;s kool for an actor I
don&#x27;t like.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/the-bourne-ultimatum-2007/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;If we ignore the more spectacular car chase&#x2F;crash, the movie is overall
lesser than the 2nd, but superior to the 1st of course. It&#x27;s not the
best because it feels like a mere rehash, and doesn&#x27;t bring much new to
celebrate, despite the fact the we get to know of Bourne&#x27;s past, but
even that is told in some badly-made flashbacks.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie got camerawork and production design very similar to the 2nd
movie, with similar intensity fo story, except that I got a bit bored
(remember the rehashness of it). It&#x27;s kinda strange because I remember
praising this concluding episode as superior to the rest.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Julia Stiles should not have been given a bigger role. She is not an
interesting enough actor. Even worse (worst performance in the trilogy)
is the guy playing the biker assassin. Other performances are decent
enough... nothing spectacular. Luckily, the last assassin here is
played quite well, better than any in the series.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;strong&gt;sidenote&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;] One uncomfortable aspect of this movie is that Bourne
really takes too much physical punishment to continue going. It was
forgiveable in the previous 2 movies, but in here it&#x27;s way too much (he
experiences so many heavy car crashes, and then simply walks out of
then). It&#x27;s sad because the series has been as close to convincing as
action movies are allowed, and that added to the fun.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;A skillfully-done experimental tragedy told backwards, having among the
most horrific scenes I&#x27;ve yet seen in any movie, and I&#x27;m not referring
to the rape scene, prolonged as it was (isn&#x27;t it the longest rape scene
ever?). There&#x27;s good acting and dialog, complete with high levels of
realism.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/the-life-of-david-gale-2003/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;A very well-made political drama focused on the issue of death penalty.
Full of good performances, my favorite being the lawyer of the title
character. I have, for a long time, considered it a masterpiece, which
was perhaps careless, considering that I don&#x27;t remember watching it
more than once. A revisit wasn&#x27;t quite as impactful, but the movie
remains impressive. The last twist is okay, but maybe needless (and
earned the movie dislike from many). A better twist happens earlier in
the movie.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The punishment that David Gale goes through, after cheating on his wife
and beeing falsely accused of rape, is rather too much, especially when
refused access to his child. It reminds me of the injustice suffered by
the ever-drunk lead character found in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;crazy-heart-2009&quot;&gt;Crazy Heart&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; at the hand of his
lover.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;The character design is quite impressive, all but the purple dog and the
monsters. The oversized warrior is an admirable character, due to his
great (and naive) kindness, and of course, his looks (design). The
movie&#x27;s best design is however the servant of the gal&#x27;s father, even
though it&#x27;s the kind seen before (that of villainous characters).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world of the movie is unlike I&#x27;ve seen before, a world with weird
gravitational behavior, with pieces of ground constantly breaking from
the land and floating in the air. It&#x27;s a dark story that, sadly, feels
too short.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;A fun ride, following a former gangster trying to collect enough ransom
money to get son back. I&#x27;m not happy with the lead performance and the
pretty sidekick (so damn kissable!), but the rest of the cast is pretty
good, and the lead villain especially fearsome, though far less so than
on the first viewing. The ending is shitty and the police are too stupid
to be belieavable. The direction is quite good. It&#x27;s strange why the
movie wasn&#x27;t so popular in the Black community, especially since it&#x27;s
in the same level of the far-more-popular &lt;em&gt;Set It Off&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

interesting in places, with the main villain (Anthony Hopkins) being the
most interesting character, and Jodie Foster (the FNB agent the villain
toys with) looking as disrtubed-looking as usual.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Poking a lotta fun at some the blind adherance and factionalism that is
all too common in society, and doing it in a very humorous way. This is
brilliant humor by the way. The effort of making the costumes and the
environment feel authentic is impressive. The only real annoyance is the
character of Brian&#x27;s mom.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, unlike &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;monty-python-s-quest-for-the-holy-grail-1975&quot;&gt;Holy Grail&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, it doesn&#x27;t feel too much like a
collection of gags.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Very shallow story, very entertaining direction (best of which are the
fantasy martial arts), very funny in places, and very charming, but
muddled with cheap and childish ethics. A totally beloved gal, who
happens to be funny too (check the ghost dress and the sexy pose).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;My memory sucks but this is the best chick flick I&#x27;ve seen yet.
Although some of the humor is recycled, it doesn&#x27;t feel so. Much of it
is quite good and original. There are good performances from the lead
and the lady getting married. The traffic cop isn&#x27;t bad either, but the
movie&#x27;s most interesting character is the masculine lady. I haven&#x27;t
quite experienced a tomboy character done this way. There&#x27;s the
suckiness that is so common with romantic comedies (the fallout between
best friends), and worse, merely brushed away.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On another note, it&#x27;s interesting the kind of effort that goes into
mindless things like wedding ceremonies.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I don&#x27;t remember enjoying any of Eric Bana&#x27;s performances until now;
two of American&#x27;s great sweethearts are here (the ridiculously
desirable Scarlett Johanssen and the sophisticated and disturbing
Natalie Portman). The are other good performances, and none is better
than that of &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ana_Torrent&quot;&gt;Anne Torrent&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; who plays the queen&#x27;s first wife.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie starts off as yet-another English period drama (though I liked
the detailed look at the lives of the rich and pwoerful at the time),
but the intensity of the events at the end almost led me to call it
overall excellent.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

those movies that make you lucky to live in today&#x27;s South Africa,
because it shows abuses of human freedom in East Germany in the
mid-80&#x27;s. The acting is pretty good, especially by the guy who is
taking part in the spying of the palywright. The very last moment is a
tearjecker.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Some real nice performances from the two leads, especially the guy
playing the rock star (&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Russell_Brand&quot;&gt;Russell Brand&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;). Sean Combs was fun to watch,
despite his lack of acting skill, probably due to good character
development. The movie has good humor.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;To make up for its extreme shallowness, the movie is very exciting. I
liked the concept of supreme Civil and Mechanical engineering abilities
of the little people. I also enjoyed how the movie made fun of old,
formal-sounding English. The movie also happens to be a Jack Black
vehicle, and this guy has some real good humor. What else me liked is
the robot. Also, the water effects (the storm) are amazing.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I once declared this one a masterpiece, perhaps due to the superb
direction, and the weird and wonderful storyline. Those remain
appealing, but a revisit wasn&#x27;t so favorable.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#x27;s nice performances all over the show (Laura Dern, Elias Kotes,
Helena Bonham Carter, Kevin Bacon, and all supporting characters).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;A re-imagining of a &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;seven-samurai-1954&quot;&gt;Seven Samurai&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, complete with its Toshiro
Mifune (the forest guy who is looked-down upon for not being a samurai,
and his slight rebellion), its charismatic leader, battle and acting
style (one wouldn&#x27;t guess that it was made only in 2010). The villain
is excessively brutal, more than any that Akira Kurosawa committed to
screen (if memory serves well). Luckily, the movie isn&#x27;t soiled with
the silly characters that were so common in Akira&#x27;s movies.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;A very fresh assassin movie with great romance (did you see that gal?)
and sound effects. The story is so thin (and rather meditative) that I
don&#x27;t know what to make of the movie. Many unexplained things happen,
but I guess that&#x27;s not exactly a weakness. Rather, it&#x27;s implied. The
uncomfortable situation our protagonist finds self in is quite edgy, and
it makes me wanna NOT become a gangster. The intense violence is always
unsettling, especially if it&#x27;s merely imminent.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/a-prophet-2009/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Some serious storytelling here and is unlike anything I&#x27;ve seen before,
other than a resemblance to the mini-series, &lt;em&gt;Blood In, Blood Out&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. An
epic prison movie, though something I don&#x27;t really wanna see again.
There&#x27;s very little happy things going on. There&#x27;s a beautiful visual
(the accident) and an interesting concept (one guy taking on a few
gunmen).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with movies is that they tend to go through different
episodes, which sadly often don&#x27;t quite compare to each other. This
situation is worse for long movies like this one (3hrs). The setup is
quite intense. It&#x27;s so good that I was expecting more than what
ultimately transpired (the slow rise of our &#x27;hero&#x27; through the ranks,
and the complex politics surrounding him). It&#x27;s good direction, but it
could have been better, and this lead of hours, although he competently
leads the movie, falls short at times. Reminds me of Liam Neeson in
&lt;em&gt;Schindler&#x27;s List&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

senseless fun ride, following a few broke-ass high school kids, chasing

development.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the most original of all vampire movies I&#x27;ve seen. Nice
performance from the little gal playing the vampire. Also, though it
kills the innocent, you do feel compassion for it. It&#x27;s origins are
sadly left unexplained. It remained captivating throughout even though
the pacing is slow and the gloss is limited.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;strong&gt;sidenote&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;] The re-make had good reviews, so I went into it
excited, only to be &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;let-me-in-2010&quot;&gt;seriously disappointed&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Full of powerful moments and superb acting; a very original story and
desirable gals (especially the newest member of the group). Takes some
patience initially, and its eccentricity (and film stock) doesn&#x27;t help.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <link>http://tshepang.net/shelter-2010/</link>
                <guid>http://tshepang.net/shelter-2010/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;The movie is full of excellent performances:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Julianne Moore, but has she ever fucked up in her career?&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The lady who lost 3 sons; superb portrayal of grief.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jonathan Rhys Meyers, with a caveat that he plays a character whose
body is used as host by a number of souls (personalities of dead
people), so he doesn&#x27;t always keep up.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cinematography, production, and direction are top-notch. The script
(and dialogue) is quite good as well, until we get beyond roughly an
hour, where, like many movies that start well, the writers don&#x27;t know
where to take the script. That&#x27;s where the explanation of the story
must come in, and maybe it&#x27;s because I find supernatural claims shitty,
but it&#x27;s just not done well. We get offerred standard horror fare,
nothing good enough to justify the whole thing. Fuck, there&#x27;s even a
moment where our heroic psychologist plays action hero. Eish!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;strong&gt;sidenote&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;] Regardless of the shitness, I think the movie received
too little attention from mainstream critics and audience. We must
probably blame the marketing team too.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/the-king-s-speech-2010/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Geoffrey Rush, who plays the speech therapist, gives an amazing
performance. He always delivers good performances, but this was perhaps
his best ever. The moment he was sitting on the kings&#x27; chair was
wonderfully humorous.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colin Firth, who plays the title character, did very well too. I don&#x27;t
remember enjoying any of his other work, and this is probably the best
he&#x27;s done yet too. He even got awards for it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Helena Bonham Carter is always a pleasure to watch. Here she plays the
king&#x27;s wife.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The production design is amazing.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie drags a bit, especially for the tiny story it tells.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I had great fun watching this. I can&#x27;t even tell which I enjoyed more
between it and another superb Tim Burton movie, &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;alice-in-wonderland-2010&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alice In
Wonderland&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, nor which is better. The humor, which is solely driven by
the very capable Johnny Depp, is spot-on, while the mightily desirable
Christina Ricci is put there as an excuse for a love interest. The
character design of the headless horseman is wonderful, and so are the
caricatures of the villagers, especially the priest; Tim Burton is
master of caricatures, and I love quality caricatures. His imagery and
atmosphere is also great.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Here&#x27;s what I wrote over 3 years ago:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with superb-handling and wonderful acting, it lacks intrigue (bar
the memorable scene where the femme fatale gets uncomfortable
treatment), so I&#x27;m only left with great cinematography and excellent
sound.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;d like to take away the &amp;quot;it lacks intrigue&amp;quot; part. It&#x27;s more
accurate to say it&#x27;s not intriguing enough. That&#x27;s because it was fun
watching the planning, buying info, and even the executions themselves.
Also, I choose just two performances as outstanding (Geoffrey Rush and
Daniel Craig); Eric Bana (playing the lead character) isn&#x27;t interesting
enough to be alone on screen. The movie gets dull after that femme
fatale incident due to the slower pacing. As realistic as the story
feels, the info salesmen were rather romanticised. I found the aging
leader, papa, a mere caricature. Not fresh.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wife is oh-so-gorgeous&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;quality performances by the wife and the husband; each was a
pleasure to watch&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;my shitty memory says that this is the best couple quarrel in my
movie history; oh, and her abuse was rather intense, and unbearably
so; it was so horrid that when hubby retaliated physically, it felt
like justice (and this is from someone who can&#x27;t bear the thought
of male-hit-woman acts)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;edgy like fuck, and without abusing it&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;how the fuck can an 8-year-old throw a knife so well, so far?&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;unexplained story; all of that, and for what, exactly?&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;I haven&#x27;t seen this one probably in over ten years, and I remember
enjoying excellently well, much like now. Of course it&#x27;s a popcorn,
laid-back comedy, but it&#x27;s amazingly entertaining.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;pros&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The few heavy-duty words found on many of the movie&#x27;s lines adds to
great comic effect.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A truly fun performance by the guy playing Bill.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The effort that went into designing the worlds of the historical
characters, their constumes, and their character design is
impressive, especially for a movie of this nature.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;cons&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keany Reeves was as bad as he is today. Damn, what a let-down.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Well, the visual effects should not count, since the movie is like
ancient&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An extremely shallow story&#x2F;plot.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The honorable Abraham Lincoln should have been given something to
say.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;A had a lot of fun watching this, more fun than first time around (&amp;gt; 10
years ago), if memory serves well. The lead character, a tiny version of
Woody Allen, was fun to watch and listen to.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <title>Crazy Heart (2009)</title>
                <pubDate>Mon, 31 May 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

                <description>&lt;p&gt;So this sweet lady (Maggie Gyllenhaal) falls for this alcoholic guy (and
I wonder why since the guy looks like he smells like shit; maybe it&#x27;s
because she a sucker for the guy&#x27;s music). She allows the guy to chill
with her kid with the condition that he not drink in front of him. Well,
it does happen, and the guy loses the kid while both are in a bar,
though the kid is found hours later. As would be expected, &#x27;sweet
lady&#x27; goes mad and despite repeated pleading, does not forgive the guy.
I think that&#x27;s harsh, even for him. One good outcome however was that
that was a wake-up call for him to actually quit drinking, and he even
accepted the break-up (I didn&#x27;t).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie is good, but boring. The acting is even better, especially
from the lead, Jeff Bridges (who looks so much like Kris Kristofferson,
I thought it was him). Maggie is as desirable as usual.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <title>Kinsey (2004)</title>
                <pubDate>Wed, 24 Feb 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
                <link>http://tshepang.net/kinsey-2004/</link>
                <guid>http://tshepang.net/kinsey-2004/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;The title character of Kinsey, who is granted a committed performance by
Liam Neeson, is a relentless and brave scientist who embarks on studies
of human sexuality. The movie&#x27;s academic and smart dialogue reminds me
pretty much of &lt;em&gt;Wit&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, and among its notable moments was a touching scene
where Kinsey feels pain for his father&#x27;s past, a moment that brought
tear to eye, though nothing compared to the volume of tear delivered by
a later interview with an elderly lady who happened to be grateful of
the professor&#x27;s book. The movie itself is a serious work, and one
that&#x27;s totally devoid of cinematic gloss.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prof Kinsey must be my favorite human character in my movie memory
(stern, professional, unflinchingly unapologetic about the scientific
value of his work, intelligent, brave, adventurous, and brutally
honest). I won&#x27;t risk my integrity by saying he&#x27;s the best-developed
character in that admittedly weak memory, but when thinking of such a
guy who went against the status quo by doing controversial research in
American&#x27;s sexual deeds, a tear nearly fills the eye.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leeson&#x27;s performance, excellent as it is, isn&#x27;t award-worthy, but I&#x27;m
too shallow to imagine anyone who can better him in this role.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/fracture-2007/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;A notable element from this movie is the performance of the lead by Ryan
Gosling, who is sort of like a hit from nowhere since I haven&#x27;t seen
him before. Yet another notable element is the sophisticated and
humorous dialogue, though the script itself falls short near the end,
incapable of justifying various activities done by the villain.
Fortunately there wasn&#x27;t any formulaic non-sense common in movies.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story proved a bit sketchy and not so brilliant on second look,
while Rosamund Pike remains a goddess, while Anthony Hopkins pulls off a
great and effortless performance.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;This Bond we find in &lt;em&gt;Quantum of Solace&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; must be the most intense yet,
and partakes in equally-intense thrills, and in what is perhaps the best
Bond movie yet. Actually the movie&#x27;s first half (and its action) is so
good that it reminds of (the superior) &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;taken-2008&quot;&gt;Taken&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, even though it got
spoilt by the revenging beauty (incompetent performance, stale character
and subplot) and an even worse finale.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
