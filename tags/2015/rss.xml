                <title>Eye in the Sky</title>

                <description>&lt;p&gt;The squabbling and delegation of decision-making seen in the movie was
most entertaining, and also unique in my movie-watching experience,
complete with high-tension and interesting debates. The most admirable
character is the guy who operates the insect-sized drone.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am, however, sad due to some of the shortcuts taken, all regarding the
country the movie is set in:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The movie is set in Kenya, but there&#x27;s way too many South African
actors, a fact that could perhaps be forgiven since filming took
place in that country&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am told that the unhygienic handling of bread doesn&#x27;t happen in
Kenya&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No terrorist organisation controls any part of Kenya&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Possibly the most violent movie I&#x27;ve yet seen, this is made in the
style of video game first person shooters. I enjoyed the wonderful
performances: the villain was especially menacing, and the guide, given
multiple characters, was given an excellent performance by &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Sharlto_Copley&quot;&gt;Sharlto
Copley&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, in what is his most satisfying work since &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;district-9-2009&quot;&gt;District 9&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. The
story is also fascinating and so is the technology.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <title>2015 review</title>

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/2015-review/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;The best &lt;strong&gt;visual effects&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; can be found in the Hulk vs. Hulkbuster
battle of &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;avengers-age-of-ultron&quot;&gt;Avengers: Age of Ultron&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Runner-up is the title character of
&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;chappie&quot;&gt;Chappie&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. The greatest &lt;strong&gt;spectacle&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;jurassic-world&quot;&gt;Jurassic World&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, whose visual
effects aren&#x27;t shabby either.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best &lt;strong&gt;direction&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; can be found in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-survivalist&quot;&gt;The Survivalist&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, followed by
&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;spotlight&quot;&gt;Spotlight&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, which itself boasts best &lt;strong&gt;editing&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;dialog&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My &lt;strong&gt;favorite performance&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is that of Benedict Wong in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-martian&quot;&gt;The Martian&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
while my &lt;strong&gt;favorite villain&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is Scarlet, the lead villain of &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;minions&quot;&gt;Minions&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.
That movie also boasts best &lt;strong&gt;visual design&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. My &lt;strong&gt;favorite character&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;
is Ultron, the lead villain in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;avengers-age-of-ultron&quot;&gt;Avengers: Age of Ultron&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. The most
&lt;strong&gt;desirable gal&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is Sonoya Mizuno in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;ex-machina&quot;&gt;Ex Machina&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, which also happens
to have the &lt;strong&gt;best dialog&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <title>Avengers: Age of Ultron</title>
                <pubDate>Sat, 07 May 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
                <link>http://tshepang.net/avengers-age-of-ultron/</link>
                <guid>http://tshepang.net/avengers-age-of-ultron/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;I was not so impressed when I saw this one first time:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am afraid that the producers of the franchise are losing the plot a
little. The movie is entertaining enough, but I kept feeling it&#x27;s too
much of a money-making machine. The plot is rather messy, and the
action overly-frantic. I much prefer &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;the-avengers-2012&quot;&gt;the original&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did, however, love something in it:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite moment is the battle between Hulk and the super-sized Iron
Man. It&#x27;s a showcase of visual effects mastery, and what makes it
extra special is the setting... South Africa.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still do love the scene, but I love the villain even more. The writers
did a great job to demonstrate the fact that this character is a
super-intelligence, making him quite unusual and unpredictable,
resulting in it being unlike any character I&#x27;ve ever seen. I love his
various appearances: birth, broken robot, first meeting with the twins,
the severed arm, and the self-killing (in which he occupies a more
shitty body).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/spotlight/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Great direction and editing work serve this highly-entertaining story
about sexual abuses of Catholic priests. The characters are interesting
and impressively bold (see the new editor) and are given superb dialog.
Their commitment to the stories they tell is also admirable. What is sad
is that they are superior to the (admittedly competent) performances
they are offered.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/the-survivalist/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Amazing direction keeps one absorbed throughout the movie, even given
the numerous slow&#x2F;quiet moments. The acting is also decent and the
story, though minimal, exciting. The opening scene, that of the 2
graphs, is very scary, offering a good intro.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/the-martian/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s a rare experience for me to watch a movie after reading the novel
it&#x27;s based on. There are so many comparisons, and those can result in
complaints. Anyways, this was a reasonably faithful adaptation, and also
very respectful one; there are many moments where things from the novel
occur briefly even though they don&#x27;t really add to the story.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one performance that I enjoyed, which happens to be superior to all
others, is that of &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.imdb.com&#x2F;name&#x2F;nm0938950&quot;&gt;Benedict Wong&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. He felt amazingly realistic, and was
presented a very loving and admirable character. No one else impressed
me, and that includes the acclaimed one of Matt Damon in the leading
role.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/ex-machina/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Fascinating, with an eery feel that&#x27;s accentuated by the overly loud
and uncomfortable score, it also possesses wonderful direction and
dialog. Performances are also good, most impressive of which is the
lead, though &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.imdb.com&#x2F;name&#x2F;nm4420495&quot;&gt;Sonoya Mizuno&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, playing food&#x2F;sex servant, offered the most
pleasure to the eye, especially when dancing. She&#x27;s so perfect.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <title>Minions</title>

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/minions/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;I never liked the Minions from the time they were introduced, so I
didn&#x27;t expect to enjoy this, so it was a pleasant surprise to find this
movie better than the two previous ones. I thought it would be a tired
attempt at milking the franchise, but it turned out a good execution of
the concept of characters who derive purpose from serving villains.
Speaking of those, the lead villain is such a pleasure to watch,
together with the husband. Both are works of great character design and
animation. Their home is also a work of great visual design... it looks
amazing. I wish it was explored more.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <guid>http://tshepang.net/jurassic-world/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Though the story is shallow and full of shortcuts, the movie is very
enjoyable and got lots of exciting moments. &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Chris_Pratt&quot;&gt;Chris Pratt&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, whose appeal
surprised me in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;guardians-of-the-galaxy&quot;&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, also gives a nice performance
here, though none tops the humorous one of &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Irrfan_Khan&quot;&gt;Irrfan Khan&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. I was also
pleased to see &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Omar_Sy&quot;&gt;Omar Sy&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; again (saw him first time in &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tshepang.net&#x2F;good-people-2014&quot;&gt;Good People&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <link>http://tshepang.net/chappie/</link>
                <guid>http://tshepang.net/chappie/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Hugh Jackman did a good job here, more impressive the anything else
he&#x27;s done. It&#x27;s a pity that his character goes too far into
unconvincing territory where its obsession leads it to do something as
stupid as de-activating the helpful robots. But even more interesting is
the title character: it&#x27;s humorous, enchanting, and also well-animated
(invisible visual effects). None of the characters are given any depth.
Regardless, the movie is captivating, and has a great ending, fairy tale
as it is.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
