  <h1 class="post-title">Person of Interest - Season 2 Episode 16</h1>
  <span class="post-date">2013-09-06</span>
  <p>I am a big fan of the series, <em>Person of Interest</em>. There is much to
celebrate, among which is the wonderful portrayal of the brilliant
creator of the machine that (illegally) looks for patterns in society so
as to predict, with high certainty, which people will be involved in
violent crimes, either as victims or perpetrators.</p>
<p>The series' normal formula is that our heroic, bespectacled hero would
mention the details of the new person, and his very capable sidekick, a
former assassin, would go follow this person, to try avert the impending
crime. In the 16th episode of the 2nd season, however, this formula
isn't followed (by the camera). Instead we follow the person who would
be victim, and our heroes only appear midway through, like they were
secondary characters. It's beautiful.</p>
<p>I love it when such breaks from normal routine occur, especially when
they are as well-made. Not to say this is the best episode of this
series so far (I can think of a few which were superior), nor was this
the first time such a break from normal routine occur (there were some
in the earlier episodes of the season), but it felt fresh enough to be
worth a mention in this blog of mine. What added to the excitement is
that it was the first time in the series that a so-called Relevant<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup>
crime prevention was showed.</p>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="1"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">1</sup>
<p>This means <em>relevant</em> to (U.S.) national security. This is as
opposed to the sort solved by our heroes, which only involve civil
cases.</p>
