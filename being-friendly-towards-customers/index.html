  <h1 class="post-title">being friendly towards customers</h1>
  <span class="post-date">2008-07-16</span>
  <p>I just a read <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000052.html">a very interesting post</a> on how to gain market share, and
what prompted me to post is the following snippet which states the
advantages of being friendly towards customers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...It reminds me of independent booksellers, who said &quot;why should I
make it comfortable for people to read books in my store? I want them
to buy the books!&quot; And then one day Barnes and Nobles puts <em>couches</em>
and <em>cafes</em> in the stores and practically <em>begged</em> people to read
books in their store without buying them. Now you've got all these
customers sitting in their stores for <em>hours</em> at a time, mittengrabben
all the books with their filthy hands, and the probability that they
find something they want to buy is linearly proportional to the amount
of time they spend in the store, and even the dinkiest Barnes and
Nobles superstore in Iowa City rakes in hundreds of dollars a <em>minute</em>
while the independent booksellers are going out of business. Honey,
Shakespeare and Company on Manhattan's Upper West Side did <em>not</em>
close because Barnes and Nobles had cheaper prices, it closed because
Barnes and Nobles had <em>more human beings in the building</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I used to frequent some local book/magazine franchise whose merchandise
I liked but just couldn't afford. That made the experience
uncomfortable, the risk of being told to leave.</p>
