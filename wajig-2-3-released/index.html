  <h1 class="post-title">wajig 2.3 released</h1>
  <span class="post-date">2012-03-25</span>
  <p>It's been many months since wajig was released, but this was about as
good as any since I probably did far more work on it than on any other
release so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The most user-visible change is that I changed the UI to feel more
standard/natural, where each of the wajig COMMANDS are 1st-class
citizens. Let me give an example of user wanting to install a
package named nautilus, but avoid installing its Recommends
depencencies:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b">
<span style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;"># ole
</span><span style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;">wajig —norecommends INSTALL nautilus
</span><span style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;"># new
</span><span style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;">wajig INSTALL —norecommends nautilus
</span></pre>
<p>I call this natural because it makes more sense to have the
<code>--norecommends</code> command line option to be specified <em>after</em> the
(wajig) subcommand it modifies. Also, the way it was implemented
previously, the option would silently be ignored if it was used in a
case where it was irrelevant. That's not good, and it links to the
next user-visible change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is less magic and more strictness. Previously, these commands
resulted in the same outcome:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b">
<span style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;">wajig REMOVEORPHANS
</span><span style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;">wajig REMOVE-ORPHANS
</span><span style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;">wajig R-____EMOVE-ORPH+++-___AN_S
</span></pre>
<p>What wajig did was simply sanitise the commands, getting rid of the
junk. Well, I don't like that, but since I didn't want to break
people's commands/aliases/scripts I actually tried to preserve that
functionality, but argparse didn't let me do that, and messing
around with <code>sys.argv</code> before argparse jumped in was an error-prone
mess, which links us to the next change, this time
behind-the-scenes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I replaced the archaic <code>getopt</code> CLI parser with a far more powerful
<code>argparse</code>. This change alone, when I truly embraced it, using its
subcommand methods (see point 1 above), resulting in a ridiculous
work that involved mainly unfun work and resulted in changing
(adding and removing) thousands of lines code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The output of command <code>wajig COMMANDS</code> is now generated dynamically,
instead of simply being read from a separate file. Advantage is that
it should now remain more up-to-date.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The usage info for each COMMAND was store on its own file, and the
aliases were symblic links to them. Now that's ugly, but I did it
that was some time ago because I could not think of a better, quick
way. The ugly solution is simple, but it added over a 100 files in
user machines, which is just bad design. Well, modern Linux-based
package management makes such invisible to all but the most
avid/curious users, but I never liked it anyways. Now, all of that
help info is auto-generated by <code>argparse</code> (you can imagine I'm a
big fan of that module by now).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There's bunch of other changes, though most was code stuff. As for
the user-visible stuff, a few COMMANDS were removed, a few options
added/removed. <a href="http://packages.qa.debian.org/w/wajig/news/20120322T223441Z.html">Here's 'all' the gory details</a>.</p>
