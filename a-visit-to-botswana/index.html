  <h1 class="post-title">a visit to Botswana</h1>
  <span class="post-date">2010-04-13</span>
  <p>This past weekend, I finally went to this neighbouring country of ours,
Botswana. This was the first time I ever left South Africa. I was
welcomed by wonderful people, and the visit was limited to its largest
city +++ Gaborone +++ which is beautiful, sparse, and vast, when
compared to my country's own cities.</p>
<p>One of its residents got shocked when I argued that South Africa
doesn't have a unifying identity; I argued that the country is too
diverse to have such. Instead she argued that such is country's very
strength which led to her pointing out the following wins:</p>
<ul>
<li>diverse (and therefore strong) economy; she stated Botswana is
over-reliant on diamonds</li>
<li>diverse tourist attractions; Botswana's tourism is nearly
non-existent in comparison</li>
<li>diverse export market; Botswana is all diamonds, again</li>
<li>press freedom - my input, which she agreed with</li>
<li>high foreign investment</li>
<li>diverse cultures</li>
<li>high media production standards; Botswana has only one tv channel
and the little exposure I got of it expresses amateurish levels of
production</li>
<li>passionate people (highlighting freedom fighters that enabled black
rule; highlighting the toyi-toyi culture)</li>
</ul>
<p>The conversation opened my eyes a little bit, that there's a lot to
appreciate about South Africa. As I talked to more Botswana residents,
and read one critical piece of journalistic writing, Botswana, despite
being far more peaceful and having superior living standards (minimal
crime, kindly people, minimal poverty, far-reaching welfare), has some
serious smelly bits: abortion and homosexuality are illegal. I was
shocked by these two, and most especially about the second one. What the
fuck!</p>
