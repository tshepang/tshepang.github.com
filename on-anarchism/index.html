  <h1 class="post-title">on Anarchism</h1>
  <span class="post-date">2010-09-14</span>
  <p>There have been many great benefits I got from <a href="http://www.debian.org">the Debian project</a>,
among the most important being an introduction to Anarchism, a radical
political theory that opposes all forms of official hierarchy
(capitalism, communism, religion, etc), arguing that such things tend to
result in oppression.</p>
<p>How I got access to that is via a package known as <a href="http://packages.debian.org/stable/anarchism">anarchism</a>, a set of
documents formally known as <a href="http://anarchism.pageabode.com/afaq/index.html">An Anarchist FAQ</a>. It's a very
comprehensive coverage of the theory, and going through it brought both
enlightenment and frustration, for it explained so many things that I
took for granted, while pointing out the causes. The theory is basically
presented as the best possible society humans could ever have.</p>
<p>As for me, I'm not sure if it's actually true, although I lean more
towards it than alternatives (and I haven't read anything extensive on
competing theories, but intuition/experience tells me that capitalism,
communism, and religion all suck tremendously). I need more study to be
more sure, especially because the objections to Anarchism are heavy.</p>
<p>To me it's a scarier concept to introduce yourself as an anarchist than
as an atheist or a homosexual, because the implications are greater. In
fact, they are so great, that the word <em>anarchy</em> itself has been
associated with chaos. That's an expected knee-jerk reaction you'll
get when you punt things like &quot;I reject all forms of official
authority, including all governments!&quot;. But it would be nice if people
who shudder at the concept to spend time with <a href="http://anarchism.pageabode.com/afaq/index.html">that great document</a>.</p>
<p>My attraction to the theory perhaps is due to my radically liberal
tendencies (e.g., I don't see anything wrong with fucking my biological
mother, provided it's consensual, and there's no pregnancy). I don't
know where these tendencies originate, considering that I was a
religious nut back in my early teens, scared of the concept of hell and
similar forms of bullshit.</p>
