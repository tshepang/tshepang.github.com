  <span class="post-date">2008-09-26</span>
  <p>I only recently realized that my oldest computer system, the first I
ever bought, has all been renewed, bar the processor, an old-style P4
(Northwood) purchased July 2004.</p>
<p>The original 80GB HDD, which I loved due to high reliability despite
serious punishment (I did so much experimenting with it including
multiple OS installations) until it failed earlier this year.</p>
<p>The motherboard failed several months ago (difficult problems involving
USB connectivity and lack of sound, all intermittent, all resulting in
emotional pain).</p>
<p>The SONY DVD-Writer which I loved due running reliably for years until
it failed earlier this year. I also lost the power supply which kept
resetting when, say for example I was inserting an optical disk and the
HDD was doing much seeking (both of which must have induced unberable
power spikes the PSU), an obvious sign of deterioration, and great
source of emotional pain too.</p>
<p>The replacement included a case as well, so yes, even the case ain't
original.</p>
<p>Additionally, I was initially all PATA (with those fucking annoying IDE
cables) and am all SATA now (luckily the replacement motherboard got 2
SATA ports, which is all I needed since I only got 1 optical drive and 1
HDD).</p>
