  <p><a href="http://stackexchange.com/sites">Stack Exchange</a> is a network of websites built to make the internet
better by providing quality Answers to Questions on specific topics. Its
flagship product is <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>, which is likely the single most
important programming resource on the web. Part of the reason of this
site's success is the excellent community built around it.</p>
<p>Among the sites that <a href="http://stackexchange.com/sites">Stack Exchange</a> has built is <a href="http://unix.stackexchange.com/">Unix &amp; Linux</a>, and
it's stated goal is to be THE place to get answers on non-programming
topics related to Unix and Linux-based systems. Note that this family of
comupter system is highly fragmented; there's literally hundreds of
them, though most can further be classified under few families:</p>
<ul>
<li>Debian (includes Ubuntu)</li>
<li>RedHat (includes SuSE)</li>
<li>BSD</li>
</ul>
<p>Given that there's a lot of similarities between them, to have one
unified place to ask questions about each of them rocks.</p>
<p>Now that's well and good, until one realises that these StackExchange
sites run on non-FLOSS. Now, consider that there are FLOSS alternatives
to these. Debian folk maintain and participate in an instance of one
such alternative, named <a href="http://shapado.com/">Shapado</a>. This instance is a place where one
can ask Debian-related questions, and is in essence a competitor to
StackExchange's Unix &amp; Linux site, and this had me in a seriously
painful dilemma: do I continue using the superior but non-FLOSS service
or the inferior but FLOSS Shapado. The following evaluation makes the
choice real easy:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://ask.debian.net/">Debian Q&amp;A</a>: FLOSS (+1) +++&gt; <strong>total=1</strong></li>
<li><a href="http://unix.stackexchange.com/">Unix &amp; Linux</a>: better community (+1), better site experience
(+1), caters to more than just Debian (+1) +++&gt; <strong>total=3</strong></li>
</ul>
